    <h1>Chapter 1: HIV & AIDS</h1>
    <p>Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.
    <p>H – Human – The HIV virus attacks human beings through their bloodstream. No other animals are susceptible to HIV.</p>
    <p>I – Immunodeficiency – HIV weakens your immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection.</p>
    <p>V – Virus – HIV is a virus that hijacks cells in the body in order to replicate itself. There is no cure for the HIV virus.</p>
    <p>Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. If the infection progresses, it interferes more
      with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function. These late symptoms of
      infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.</p>
    <h3>AIDS</h3>
    <p>AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.
      In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking HIV medicine every day as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.
      A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:</p>
    <p>
      -The number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). </p>
    (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) OR
    <p>-They develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.</p>


    <p>Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage
      of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start ART soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that’s why HIV testing is so important.</p>

    <p>A – Acquired – a person has to “catch” the HIV virus in order to develop AIDS. It doesn’t just spontaneously occur.</p>
    <p>I – “Immuno” –AIDS is caused by the immune system being depleted of its cells by HIV.</p>
    <p>D – Deficiency –Once enough white blood cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system becomes weak and is not capable of fighting off other bacteria and viruses easily.</p>
    <p>S – Syndrome ‐ AIDS is characterized by a group of symptoms including rapid weight loss; extreme fatigue; recurring fever; susceptibility to illness; sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals; pneumonia; blotches under the skin; memory loss, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Transmission</h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few ways you can get HIV. Here, we explain the ways you can get it and how to protect yourself from HIV infection.
      <h5>How can you get HIV?</h5>

      HIV is found in the following bodily fluids of someone living with the virus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>blood</li>
  <li>semen and pre-seminal fluid ('pre-cum')</li>
  <li>rectal fluids/anal mucous</li>
  <li>vaginal fluids</li>
  <li>breastmilk</li>
</ul>


    <p>For you to get HIV, these bodily fluids need to get into your blood through a mucous membrane (for example, the lining of the vagina, rectum, or the opening of the penis), via shared injecting equipment, or through broken skin (such as cuts or
      sores in the mouth or tears around the anus). There is not enough HIV virus in other bodily fluids, like saliva, sweat or urine, to transmit it from one person to another. Someone living with HIV who has an ‘undetectable’ viral load, meaning
      effective treatment has lowered the amount of virus in their blood to levels where it cannot be detected by a normal blood test, cannot pass on HIV.
      A person living with HIV with a detectable viral load can pass the virus to others whether they have symptoms or not. HIV is most infectious in the first few weeks after infection. At this time many people are unaware of their status.
      <b>The main ways you can get HIV are:
      </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Sex without a condom. Having unprotected sex with someone who has HIV, particularly unprotected vaginal sex and anal sex.</li>
      <li>Sharing injecting equipment. Sharing needles, syringes or other equipment used to prepare and inject drugs with someone who has HIV.</li>
      <li>Passed from mother-to-baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. A mother infected with HIV can pass the virus to her baby via her blood during pregnancy and birth, and through her breast milk when breastfeeding.</li>
      <li>Contaminated blood transfusions and organ/tissue transplants. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This risk is extremely small because most countries test blood products
        for HIV first.</li>
      <li>If adequate safety practices are not in place, healthcare workers can also be at risk of HIV from cuts made by a needle or sharp object (needlestick injury) with infected blood on it. However, the risk of ‘occupational exposure’, is very
        low in most countries. If you think you have been exposed to HIV, the only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Less common ways are:</b>

    <ul>
      <li>From mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. However, the use of HIV medicines and other strategies have helped lower the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to 1% or less in the United States.</li>
      <li>Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object This is a risk mainly for health care workers. The risk is very low.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>HIV is spread only in extremely rare cases by:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Having oral sex But in general, the chance that an HIV-negative person will get HIV from oral sex with an HIV-positive partner is extremely low.</li>
      <li>Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV The risk is extremely small these days because of rigorous testing of the U.S. blood supply and donated organs and tissues.</li>
      <li>Being bitten by a person with HIV Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken.</li>
      <li>Contact between broken skin Wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood contaminated body fluids.</li>
      <li>Deep, open-mouth kissing. If both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative
        partner. HIV is not spread through saliva.</li>
      <li>Eating food that has been pre-chewed by a person with HIV The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while
        chewing. The only known cases are among infants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I protect myself from HIV?</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways you can protect yourself from HIV, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some countries PrEP is available. This is a course of HIV drugs which if taken consistently as advised by your healthcare professional prevents HIV infection through sex</li>
      <li>avoiding sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment</li>
      <li>taking HIV treatment if you are a new or expectant mother living with HIV, as this will dramatically reduce the risk of passing HIV to your baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding</li>
      <li>asking your healthcare professional if the blood product you are receiving (blood transfusion, organ or tissue transplant) has been tested for HIV</li>
      <li>taking precautions if you are a healthcare worker, such as wearing protection (like gloves and goggles), washing hands after contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and safely disposing of sharp equipment</li>
      <li>if you think you have been exposed to HIV you may be able to access PEP, a 4-week course of ARV drugs taken after possible HIV exposure to prevent HIV infection. You must start PEP within 72 hours of possible exposure to be effective</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>HIV Myths</h3>
    <p>You cannot get HIV from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone who has an undetectable viral load. If a healthcare professional has confirmed that someone
        living with HIV has an undetectable viral load (meaning effective treatment has reduced the amount of
        virus in their blood so that it cannot be detected through a blood test) there is no risk of transmission.
        Undetectable = Untransmissable (U+U).
      </li>
      <li>Someone who doesn’t have HIV.
        You can only get HIV from someone who is already living with HIV.
      </li>
      <li>Touching someone who has HIV.
        HIV can only be transmitted through specific bodily fluids so you can’t get HIV from touching someone, hugging them or shaking their hand.</li>
      <li>Kissing.
        There is such a small amount of HIV in the saliva of a person living with HIV that the infection can’t be passed on from kissing
      </li>
      <li>Sweat, tears, urine or feces of someone who has HIV.
        HIV can’t be transmitted through sweat, tears, urine or feces</li>
      <li>Mutual masturbation.
        Mutual masturbation, fingering and hand-jobs can’t give you HIV. However,
        if you use sex toys make sure you use a new condom on them when switching between partners.</li>
      <li>Used condoms.
        Outside of the body, HIV in semen can only survive for a very short amount of time. So, even if a condom had sperm from an
        HIV-positive person in it, it would not pose any risk.</li>
      <li>Air.
        HIV can’t survive in air so you can’t get it from sharing a space with someone who is HIV-positive</li>
      <li>Coughs, sneezes or spit.
        There is only a trace of HIV in these bodily fluids so they can’t transmit HIV</li>
      <li>Food, drink and cooking utensils.
        HIV can’t be passed on through sharing food, drinks or cooking utensils, even if the person preparing your food is living with HIV</li>
      <li>Toilet seats, tables, door handles, cutlery, sharing towels.
        You can’t get HIV from any of these as it can only be transmitted through specific bodily fluids</li>
      <li>Water.
        HIV can’t survive in water, so you can’t get HIV from swimming pools, baths, shower areas, washing clothes or from drinking water</li>
      <li>Insects.
        You can’t get HIV from insects. When an insect (such as a mosquito) bites you it sucks your blood only – it does not inject the blood of the last person it bit</li>
      <li>Animals.
        HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which means that the infection can only be passed between humans</li>
      <li>New or sterilized needles.
        New needles can’t infect someone because they haven’t been in contact with infected blood. If used needles are cleaned and sterilised they can’t transmit HIV either</li>
      <li>Musical instruments.
        HIV can’t survive on musical instruments. Even if it is an instrument that you play using your mouth, it can’t give you HIV</li>
      <li>Tattoos and piercings.
        There is only a risk if the needle used by the professional has been used in the body of someone living with HIV and not sterilised afterwards. However,
        most practitioners are required by law to use new needles for each new client</li>
    </ul>



    <h5>HIV and AIDS are the same thing</h5>
    <p>HIV and AIDS are commonly mistaken as interchangeable terms for the same disease. However, in truth, they are distinct terms that are not transposable. HIV is a virus that attacks a person’s immune system. If left untreated, it can evolve into
      AIDS. AIDS is an immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the third and most advanced stage of infection caused by HIV. Most people who are living with HIV do not have AIDS and will never progress into the AIDS phase of the disease. HIV progresses into
      AIDS when a person’s immune system is diminished to the point of not being able to combat certain kinds of infections and cancers. To determine the stage of infection caused by HIV, a lab test is conducted to identify the number of CDR cells a
      person has, otherwise known as their “viral load.” A viral load under 200 in an HIV‐infected person indicates an AIDS diagnosis. Without medication, it can take between two to 10 years or longer for an HIV‐positive person to develop AIDS.
    </p>

    <h5>HIV diagnosis is a death sentence</h5>
    <p>
      Revolutions in medications and treatments make it possible for HIV carriers to live long, healthy lives. In the Western world, where resources are available for treatment, HIV has been downgraded from a fatal virus to a chronic life‐threatening
      illness (similar to cancer, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension). The virus becomes life‐threatening once it progresses to the third and most severe stage of HIV: AIDS. However, in many case, individuals diagnosed with AIDS can be reverted to
      HIV status after starting anti‐ HIV drug “cocktails,” regaining their health and returning to a normal life. There are many treatments that can now help people with HIV, each attacking the virus in their own way. As a result, many HIV positive
      people are living much longer and healthier lives than ever before. Medicines today can slow the growth of the virus or stop it from making copies of itself. These treatment therapies cannot fully eradicate the virus from the bloodstream, but
      are able to keep the amount of virus in the blood low or undetectable. Currently, there are many clinical and research trails that continue to bring insight into the virus and its treatments and the potential pathway to a cure. Today’s
      treatment and prevention interventions were made through scientific advances funded through federal and private investments in basic, biomedical, behavioral, and social science research. All findings point to the fact that starting treatment
      for HIV early (as soon as possible after diagnosis) significantly improves the patient’s health and reduces the risk of illness and death, decreasing the risk of onward transmission by 96%.

    <h3>Three Main Stages of HIV</h3>

      <h5>Acute Infection</h5>
  <p>
      The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no
      significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of
      cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral
      neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks. Owing to their nonspecific character, these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection. Even cases that do
      get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an unexplained fever who may have
      risk factors for the infection.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>Clinical Latency</h5>
      The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years[30] to over 20 years (on
      average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50% and 70% of people also develop
      persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months. Although most HIV-1 infected individuals have a
      detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years.[28][33] These
      individuals are classified as "HIV controllers" or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as "elite controllers" or "elite
      suppressors". They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.
    </p>
    <h5>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</h5>
    <p>

      Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around
      half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal
      candidiasis. Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections. Opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system. Which infections occur depends
      partly on what organisms are common in the person's environment. These infections may affect nearly every organ system. People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's
      lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer, occurring in 10% to 20% of people with HIV. The second-most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16%
      of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3% to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus
      (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV. Additionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers,
      sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and unintended weight loss. Diarrhea is another common symptom, present in about 90% of people with AIDS. They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological
      symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.
    </p>

    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>HIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and care. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can
      provide a full HIV diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health or community worker at a community centre or clinic. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests
      within a nationally approved testing strategy. Most widely-used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by the person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of
      infection. During this time, people experience the so-called “window” period – when HIV antibodies haven’t been produced in high enough levels to be detected by standard tests and when they may have had no signs of HIV infection, but also when
      they may transmit HIV to others. After infection, an individual may transmit HIV transmission to a sexual or drug-sharing partner or for pregnant women to their infant during pregnancy or the breastfeeding period.
      Following a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV and has started treatment they should not
      be retested. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify
      HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now becoming available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate
      linkage with treatment and care.
    </p>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>HIV disease can be managed by treatment regimens composed of a combination of three or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but highly suppresses viral replication within a person's
      body and allows an individual's immune system recovery to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off opportunistic infections and some cancers.
      Since 2016, WHO has recommended that all people living with HIV be provided with lifelong ART, including children, adolescents, adults and pregnant and breastfeeding women, regardless of clinical status or CD4 cell count. By June 2021, 187
      countries had already adopted this recommendation, covering 99% of all people living with HIV globally. In addition to the treat all strategy, WHO recommends a rapid ART initiation to all people living with HIV, including offering ART on the
      same day as diagnosis among those who are ready to start treatment. By June 2020, 82 low- and middle-income countries reported that they have adopted this policy, and approximately half of them reported country-wide implementation. Globally,
      27.5 million [26.5–27.7 million] people living with HIV were receiving ART in 2020. This equates to a global ART coverage rate of 73% [56–88%]. However, more efforts are needed to scale up treatment, particularly for children and adolescents.
      Only 54% [37–69%] of children (0–14 years old) were receiving ART at the end of 2020.
    </p>


    <h3>Who Is Most At Risk?</h3>

    <p>Anyone can contract HIV, and while IDUs are at great risk because of practices related to their drug use, anyone who engages in unsafe sex (e.g., unprotected sex with an infected partner) could be exposed to HIV infection. However, while all
      groups are affected by HIV, some are more vulnerable than others, as summarized below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Men Who Have Sex with Men.
        Gay or bisexual MSM are the most severely affected population. MSM account for just a small fraction (2 percent) of the total U.S. population, yet nearly two-thirds of all new infections occurred within this group in 2009, and one-half of all
        people living with HIV in 2008 were MSM. MSM within ethnic minority populations are at greatest risk.
      </li>
      <li>Injection Drug Users.
        Injection drug use has long been associated directly or indirectly with approximately one-third of AIDS cases in the United States. The fact that IDUs made up only 8 percent of new HIV infections in 2010 versus 23 percent in 1994–2000
        demonstrates the progress made in HIV prevention and treatment within this population. Still, much work remains; while there may be fewer new infections among IDUs, in 2009, nearly one-half of those who were HIV+ were unaware they were
        infected.
      </li>
      <li>Women.
        Heterosexual contact with an HIV+ partner accounted for over one-quarter of all new infections in 2010 and is the main way that women contract the virus (see figure), especially within ethnic minority communities. Regional variations of HIV
        incidence in women have changed over time. In the early years of the epidemic, incidence in women predominated in the Northeast, but infection rates and mortality have been steadily increasing in the southern United States.19 Although
        injection drug use has declined as a means of HIV transmission over recent years, it is still responsible for 14 percent of HIV diagnoses in women. A recent study conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported 40 percent
        of White women contracted HIV through injection drug use.20 Another factor contributing to HIV disease in women is trauma. Trauma resulting from sexual or physical abuse experienced during childhood or adulthood is increasingly associated
        with rising prevalence of HIV infection and poor health outcomes in HIV+ women.21 Comprehensive HIV treatment regimens that include mental health services are critical for this population.
      </li>
      <li>Ethnic Minorities.
        HIV surveillance data show that the rates of new HIV infection are disproportionately highest within ethnic minority populations. African- Americans account for a higher proportion of HIV infections than any other population at all stages of
        the disease from initial infection to death. Moreover, specific minority subgroups are at particular risk. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of new HIV infections among MSM occurred in minority men (Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino,
        Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native American/ Hawaiian). In addition, young minority men (13–24 years old) had the greatest increase (53 percent) of HIV infections of all groups studied between the years 2006 and 2009, occurring predominantly
        in the South. The Hispanic population accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the United States in 2009 — a rate 3 times that of the White community. A number of factors contribute to the high levels of HIV infection within this community,
        including the country of birth. For example, there is a substantially larger proportion of HIV infections attributed to injection drug use for Hispanic men born in Puerto Rico than anywhere else. Such differences underscore the need for
        interventions that are socially and culturally tailored for specific populations.
      </li>
      <li>Youth.
        Young people are also at risk for HIV infection. Approximately 9,800 people aged 13–24 were diagnosed with HIV in 2010, representing 20 percent of newly diagnosed cases, with the highest rate occurring among those aged 20–24. Particular HIV
        risk behaviors within this age group include sexual experimentation and drug abuse, which are often influenced by strong peer group relationships. Compounding this vulnerability is “generational forgetting”: Studies show that today’s youth
        may be less likely to perceive the dangers associated with HIV than are older Americans, who witnessed a higher AIDS mortality rate associated with the rapid progression from HIV to AIDS in the early years of the epidemic.
      </li>
      <li>Older People.
        Sixteen (16) percent of new diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States in 2010 occurred among individuals over the age of 50, and this number has been increasing for the past 11 years.26 Some older persons do not believe they are at risk
        and thus engage in unsafe sexual practices. The problem is further exacerbated by healthcare professionals who underestimate the vulnerability of this population. The growing number of people contracting HIV later in life, combined with the
        prolonged survival made possible by HAART, has contributed to an increasing number of people over the age of 50 living with HIV. This trend will continue, and by 2015, the over-50 population is predicted to represent one-half of all HIV/AIDS
        cases.27 The aging population presents a variety of treatment challenges. Older adults progress more rapidly to AIDS, have a greater number of age-related comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, limited mobility), and report smaller
        support networks than their younger counterparts.
      </li>
      <li>Criminal Justice System.
        The criminal justice system is burdened with a significant population of HIV-infected individuals that can be 2 to 5 times larger than that in the surrounding community.29 An estimated 1 in 7 HIV+ individuals living in the United States
        passes through this system each year.30 The criminal justice system is also burdened with significant substance abuse, with about one-half of Federal and State prisoners meeting the criteria for drug dependence or abuse.31 Yet, few offenders
        are screened for HIV,32 or receive treatment for substance abuse and other mental illness while incarcerated. This situation is further exacerbated upon reentry when released offenders often lack health insurance and fail to be linked to
        continuing treatment programs within the community. NIDA is helping to address these challenges by researching the best ways to identify and help prisoners get treatment for both drug addiction and HIV while incarcerated and in the community
        after release.
      </li>
      <li>The Differential HIV Experience of African-Americans.
        While African-Americans make up 12 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for 46 percent of new HIV infections in 2010, substantially higher than the rate for Whites or Hispanics. The majority of these were men (70 percent); however,
        African-American women also have a high rate of HIV diagnosis — nearly 20 times that of White women (see figure). More disheartening is that 1 in 16 African-American men and 1 in 32 African-American women will eventually be diagnosed with
        HIV. The causes of this HIV health disparity are complex. HIV infection prevalence is higher and more broadly represented in the African- American community compared to the White population; thus African-Americans are at increased risk of
        infection simply by choosing intimate partners within their own ethnic communities. Additionally, African-American communities experience high rates of other sexually transmitted infections, and some of these infections can significantly
        increase the risk of contracting HIV. African-Americans also tend to be diagnosed at later stages in the disease and therefore begin therapy later, increasing the length of time of their infectivity. Once engaged in HAART, African-Americans
        are more likely to discontinue therapy prematurely, risking resurgence of HIV infectivity and further health complications. To address these disparities, NIDA is encouraging research that expands and coordinates prevention and treatment
        strategies across Federal agencies and within communities to more effectively identify persons at risk and link them to the help they need. Additional efforts are being made to promote healthy lifestyle choices, safe sexual practices, and HIV
        and substance abuse treatment adherence in a way that is culturally relevant for the African-American community.

    <h3>HIV and Salons</h3>
    <p>Occupational HIV transmission is extremely rare. Only 58 cases of confirmed occupational HIV transmission to health care personnel have been reported in the United States. An additional 150 possible transmissions have also been reported to
      CDC.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I prevent occupational HIV transmission?</h3>

    <p>Follow Standard Precautions at all times. Assume that blood and other body fluids are potentially infectious.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use gloves, goggles, and other barriers when anticipating contact with blood or body fluids.</li>
      <li>Wash hands and other skin surfaces immediately after contact with blood or body fluids.</li>
      <li>Be careful when handling and disposing of sharp instruments during and after use.</li>
      <li>Use safety devices to prevent needle-stick injuries.</li>
      <li>Dispose of used syringes or other sharp instruments in a sharps container.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What if an HIV exposure happens at work?</h3>
    <p>If you are exposed to HIV at work, report your exposure to the appropriate person, and see a doctor or visit an emergency room right away. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can reduce your chance of getting HIV infection. It must be started
      within 72 hours (3 days) after you may have been exposed to HIV. But the sooner you start PEP, the better. Every hour counts! Clinicians caring for personnel who’ve had a possible exposure can call the PEPline (1-888-448-4911) for advice on
      managing the exposure.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Chapter 2: Sanitation & Sterilization</h1>
    <br>

    <h3>Cleaners, Sanitizers, and Disinfectants</h3>
    <p>
      Cleaners or detergents are products that are used to remove soil, dirt, dust, organic matter, and germs (like bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Cleaners or detergents work by washing the surface to lift dirt and germs off surfaces so they can be
      rinsed away with water. The same thing happens when you wash your hands with soap and water or when you wash dishes. Rinsing is an important part of the cleaning process. Use these products for routine cleaning of surfaces.
      <br>
      Sanitizers are used to reduce germs from surfaces but not totally get rid of them. Sanitizers reduce the germs from surfaces to levels that are considered safe.
      <br>
      Disinfectants are chemical products that destroy or inactivate germs and prevent them from growing. Disinfectants have no effect on dirt, soil, or dust. Disinfectants are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    </p>
    <h3>CDC – Infection Control Guidelines</h3>
    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed Guidelines for Disinfection and Sterilization. They provide the following information:
    </p>
    <h5>Cleaning</h5>
    <p>The removal of foreign material (e.g., soil, and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is required before high-level disinfection and sterilization
      because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of salon implements and equipment interfere with the effectiveness
      of disinfection and sterilization. Also, if soiled materials dry, the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective. With manual cleaning, the two essential components are
      friction and soap/detergents and water. Friction (e.g., rubbing/scrubbing the soiled area with a brush) is an old and dependable method. Soap/detergents and water is used to remove soil and debris.
    </p>
    <h5>Disinfection</h5>
    <p>Many chemical disinfectants are used alone or in combinations. These include chlorine and chlorine compounds, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Commercial formulations based on these chemicals are considered unique products and
      must be registered with EPA or cleared by FDA. In most instances, a given product is designed for a specific purpose and is to be used in a certain manner. Therefore, users should read labels carefully to ensure the correct product is selected
      for the intended use and applied efficiently. Disinfectants are not interchangeable, and incorrect concentrations and inappropriate disinfectants can result in excessive costs. Because occupational diseases have been associated with use of
      several disinfectants such as chlorine, precautions (e.g., gloves and proper ventilation) should be used to minimize exposure. Asthma and reactive airway disease can occur in sensitized persons exposed to any airborne chemical, including
      germicides. Clinically important asthma can occur at levels below ceiling levels regulated by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or recommended by NIOSH (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health). The
      following is information that can be used to select an appropriate disinfectant for any item and use it in the most efficient way.
    </p>
    <b>Properties of an Ideal Disinfectant</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Broad spectrum: should have a wide antimicrobial spectrum</li>
      <li>Fast acting: should produce a rapid kill</li>
      <li>Not affected by environmental factors: should be active in the presence of organic matter (e.g.,blood, sputum, feces) and compatible with soaps, detergents, and other chemicals encountered in use
      </li>
      <li>Nontoxic: should not be harmful to the user or patron</li>
      <li>Surface compatibility: should not corrode instruments and metallic surfaces and should not cause the deterioration of cloth, rubber, plastics, and other materials</li>
      <li>Residual effect on treated surfaces: should leave an antimicrobial film on the treated surface</li>
      <li>Easy to use with clear label directions</li>
      <li>Odorless: should have a pleasant odor or no odor to facilitate its routine use</li>
      <li>Economical: should not be prohibitively high in cost</li>
      <li>Solubility: should be soluble in water</li>
      <li>Stability: should be stable in concentrate and use-dilution</li>
      <li>Cleaner: should have good cleaning properties</li>
      <li>Environmentally friendly: should not damage the environment on disposal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Barbicide</h3>
    <p>Barbicide is a disinfectant solution used by barbers and cosmetologists for sterilizing grooming tools such as combs and hair-cutting shears. Manufactured by King Research, it was invented in 1947 by Maurice King and marketed heavily around
      the United States by his brother James. Barbicide is a United States Environmental Protection Agency approved combination germicide, pseudomonacide, fungicide, and a viricide effective against the HIV-1 virus
      (AIDS virus), Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. Its active ingredient is Alkyl dimethyl
      benzyl ammonium chloride (5.12% by volume); sodium nitrite and blue dye are also present. Contact can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, and consumptionof 50 mL can cause shock and may lead to death if not treated quickly. Barbicide is sold
      as a concentrate diluted for use in a 1:32 ratio with water, with
      each stylist having a container for treating their own tools. At one time, several US states legally required barber shops to use Barbicide; according to the maker two still did in 1997. A jar of Barbicide sits on display in the Smithsonian
      Institution's National Museum of American History.
    </p>

    <h3>Chlorine and Chlorine Compounds</h3>
    <p>Hypochlorites, the most widely used of the chlorine disinfectants, are available as liquid (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or solid (e.g., calcium hypochlorite). The most prevalent chlorine products in the United States are aqueous solutions of
      5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite, usually called household bleach. They have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, do not leave toxic residues, are unaffected by water hardness, are inexpensive and fast acting, remove dried or fixed
      organisms and biofilms from surfaces, and have a low incidence of serious toxicity. Sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in household bleach (5.25-6.15%) can produce ocular irritation or oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric burns.
      Other disadvantages of hypochlorites include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations (>500 ppm), inactivation by organic matter, discoloring or “bleaching” of fabrics, and the release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or
      other household cleaning agents. EPA has determined the currently registered uses of hypochlorites will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to the environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Quaternary Ammonium Compounds</h3>
    <p>Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) are a type of chemical that is
      used to kill bacteria, viruses, and mold. QACs are widely used as
      disinfectants. The quaternaries are good cleaning agents, but high water
      hardness and materials such as cotton and gauze pads can make them less
      microbicidal because of insoluble precipitates or cotton and gauze pads
      absorb the active ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Microbicidal Activity of QACs</h3>
    <p>Results from manufacturers’ data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital grade disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against most viruses.
    </p>

    <h3>Salon Computer Keyboards</h3>
    <p>Quaternary ammonium compounds (as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, phenolic, and a chlorine- containing wipes effectively (>95%) remove and/or inactivate contaminants from computer keyboards with a 5-second application time. No functional damage
      or cosmetic changes occurred to the computer keyboards after 300 applications of the disinfectants.
    </p>

    <h3>EPA and FDA</h3>
    <p>In the United States, chemical germicides formulated as sanitizers, disinfectants, or sterilants are regulated in interstate commerce by the Antimicrobials Division, Office of Pesticides Program, EPA, under the authority of the Federal
      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended. Under FIFRA, any substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest (including microorganisms but excluding those in or on living
      humans or animals) must be registered before sale or distribution. To obtain a registration, a manufacturer must submit specific data about the safety and effectiveness of each product. For example, EPA requires manufacturers of sanitizers,
      disinfectants, or chemical sterilants to test formulations by using accepted methods for microbiocidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans. The manufacturers submit these data to EPA along with proposed labeling. If EPA
      concludes the product can be used without causing “unreasonable adverse effects,” then the product and its labeling are registered, and the manufacturer can sell and distribute the product in the United States.
    </p>

    <h3>Sterilization</h3>
    <p>Sterilization destroys all microorganisms on the surface of an article or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. The use of inadequately sterilized items represents a high risk of transmitting
      pathogens.
      The concept of what constitutes “sterile” is measured as a probability of sterility for each item to be sterilized. This probability is commonly referred to as the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the product and is defined as the probability
      of a single viable microorg anism occurring on a product after sterilization. SAL is normally expressed a 10. For example, if the probability of a spore surviving were one in one million, the SAL would be 10−6. In short, a SAL is an estimate of
      lethality of the entire sterilization process and is a conservative calculation.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquid Chemicals</h3>
    <p>Several FDA-cleared liquid chemical sterilants include indications for sterilization of implements. The indicated contact times range from 3 hours to 12 hours. These solutions are commonly used as high-level disinfectants when a shorter
      processing time is required.
    </p>

    <h3>Ultraviolet Radiation (UV)</h3>
    <p>UV radiation has been used in the disinfection of drinking water, air, and contact lenses. Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by UV light than are bacterial spores. The wavelength of UV radiation ranges from 328 nm to 210 nm
      (3280 A to 2100 A). Its maximum bactericidal effect occurs at 240–280 nm. Mercury vapor lamps emit more than 90% of their radiation at 253.7 nm, which is near the maximum microbicidal activity. Inactivation of microorganisms results from
      destruction of nucleic acid through induction of thymine dimers.
    </p>

    <h3>Hand-hygiene</h3>
    <p>Washing hands at key times with soap and water is one of the most important steps you can take to get rid
      of germs and avoid spreading germs to those around you. Handwashing helps prevent infections for these reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>People often touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without realizing it, introducing germs into their bodies</li>
      <li>Germs from unwashed hands may get into foods and drinks when people prepare or consume them</li>
      <li>Germs can grow in some types of foods or drinks and make people sick. Germs from unwashed hands can be transferred to other objects, such as door knobs, tables, or toys, and then transferred to another person’s hands</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Correct way to wash your hands</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Wet your hands with clean running water (warm or cold) and apply soap</li>
      <li> Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap</li>
      <li>Scrub all surfaces of your hands, including the palms, backs, fingers, between your fingers, and under your nails. Keep scrubbing
        for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice</li>

      <li>Rinse your hands under clean, running water</li>
      <li>Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them</li>
    </ol>
<h5>When to wash your hands</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Before, during, and after preparing food</li>
  <li>Before eating food</li>
  <li>Before and after caring for someone who is sick</li>
  <li>Before and after treating a cut or wound</li>
  <li>After using the bathroom, changing diapers, or cleaning up a child who has used the bathroom</li>
  <li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
  <li>After touching an animal, animal food or treats, animal cages, or animal feces (poop)</li>
  <li>After touching garbage</li>
  <li>If your hands are visibly dirty or greasy</li>
</ul>

<h5>Types of soap you should to use</h5>
    <p>You can use bar soap or liquid soap to wash your hands. Many public places provide liquid soap because it’s easier and cleaner to share with others. Studies have not found any added health benefit from using soaps containing antibacterial
    ingredients when compared with plain soap. Both are equally effective in getting rid of germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand
    sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>

<h5>Hand Sanitizers</h5>
    <p>Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to reduce the number of germs on them in most situations. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers
    can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in some
    situations, but sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs and might not remove harmful chemicals. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
</p>
<p>How to use hand sanitizers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount)</li>
  <li>Rub your hands together</li>
  <li>Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry</li>
</ul>
<p>Appropriate hand hygiene includes diligently cleaning fingernails, which may harbor dirt and germs and can contribute to the spread of some infections. Before clipping or grooming nails, all equipment should be properly cleaned. Sterilizing
equipment before use is especially important. Infections of the fingernails are often characterized by swelling of the surrounding skin, pain in the surrounding area, or thickening of the nail. In some cases, these infections may be serious and
need to be treated by a physician.</p>

    <h5>To help prevent the spread of germs and nail infections:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Scrub the underside of nails with soap and water (or a nail brush) every time you wash your hands</li>
  <li>Clean any nail grooming tools before use</li>
  <li>Sterilize nail grooming tools before use</li>
  <li>Avoid biting or chewing nails</li>
  <li>Avoid cutting cuticles, as they act as barriers to prevent infection</li>
  <li>Never rip or bite a hangnail. Instead, clip it with a clean, sanitized nail trimmer</li>
</ul>


<h5>Handwashing helps fight antibiotic resistance</h5>
    <p>Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria resist the effects of an antibiotic – that is, germs are not killed and they continue to grow. Sicknesses caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be harder to treat. Simply using antibiotics creates
    resistance, so avoiding infections in the first place reduces the
    amount of antibiotics that have to be used and reduces the likelihood that resistance will develop during treatment. Handwashing helps prevent many sicknesses, meaning less use of antibiotics.
</p>

<h3>Antiseptics</h3>
<p>  Antiseptics are a substance that inhibits the proliferation of infectious microorganisms. Proliferation is the growth or production of cells by multiplication of parts. Google explains them this way: antiseptic
  (anti-sep-tik) n. a chemical, such as chlorhexidine or cetrimide, that destroys or inhibits the growth of disease-causing bacteria and other microorganisms. Antiseptics are used externally to cleanse wounds and internally to treat infections of
  the intestine and bladder. Encyclopedia.com explains antiseptics as: An antiseptic is a substance that inhibits the growth and development of microorganisms. For practical purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topical agents, for
  application to skin, mucous membranes, and inanimate objects, although a formal definition includes agents that are used internally, such as the urinary tract antiseptics.
</p>

<h5>Purpose</h5>
    <p>Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs that are applied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for their anti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal (kills bacteria) or bacteriostatic (stops the growth of bacteria). Their
    uses include cleansing of skin and wound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfaces prior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disinfection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oral hygiene. Antiseptics are also used
    for disinfection of inanimate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces. <br>
    Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide. Other agents that have been used for this purpose, but have largely been supplanted by more effective or
    safer agents, include boric acid and volatile oils such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen).</p>

<p>Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when applied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oral rinses and preoperative total body
washes.<br>

Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used primarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium may also find application as a disinfecting agent for instruments, and in low concentration as a preservative for drugs including ophthalmic
solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inactivated by organic compounds, including soap, and must not be applied to areas that have not been
fully rinsed.<br>

Hydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of oxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydrogen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygen bubbles produces an effervescent action, which may be useful for
wound cleansing through removal of tissue debris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may be reduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropriate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic use is 3%, although higher concentrations are
available.</p><br>

<h5>Precautions</h5>
    <p>Precautions vary with individual product and use. Hypersensitivity reactions should be considered with organic compounds such as chlorhexidine, benzalkonium and hexachlorophine. Skin dryness and irritation should be considered with all products,
    but particularly with those containing alcohol.
    Most antiseptics have not been rated according to pregnancy category under the pregnancy risk factor system. Hexachlorophene is schedule C during pregnancy, and should not be used on newborns due to risk of systemic absorption with potential
    central nervous system (CNS) effects, including convulsions. Application of hexachlorophene to open wounds, mucous membranes, or areas of thin skin, such as the genitalia, should be avoided, since this may promote systemic absorption.
    Chlorhexidine should not be instilled into the ear. There is one anecdotal report of deafness following use of chlorhexidine in a patient with a perforated eardrum. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been reported; however there is
    one anecdotal report of an infant developing slowed heartbeat apparently related to maternal use of chlorhexidine.</p>

<h5>Interactions</h5>
    <p>Antiseptics are not known to interact with any other skin products. However, they should not be used together with any other topical cream, solution, or ointment.</p>

<h3>Lice infestation</h3>
    <p>A lice infestation, or pediculosis, is caused by parasites living on human skin. Lice are tiny, wingless insects with sucking mouthparts that feed on human blood and lay eggs on body hair or in clothing. Lice bites can cause intense itching.
      There are three related species of human lice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis</li>
        <li>body lice, Pediculosis humanus corpus</li>
        <li>pubic lice, Phthirus pubis, commonly called crab lice</li>
      </ul>

<p>Pediculosis capitis is an infestation of head lice. A body lice infestation is called pediculosis corporis. Pediculosis palpebrarum or phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by crab lice, is an infestation of the pubic hair. Head lice live and crawl on
the scalp, sucking blood every three to six hours. Their claws are adapted for clinging to hair or clothing. Adult head lice can be silvery-white to reddish-brown. They are about the size of a sesame seed. Female lice lay their eggs in sacs
called nits that are about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and are glued to shafts of hair close to the scalp. During her one-month lifespan a female louse may lay more than 100 eggs. The nymphs hatch in three to 14 days and must feed on blood within one
day. Nymphs are smaller and lighter in color than adults and become sexually mature after nine to 12 days. Body lice lay their nits in clothing or bedding. Occasionally the nits are attached to body hair. Body lice nits are oval and yellow to
white in color. They may not hatch for up to 30 days. Nymphs mature in about seven days. Pubic lice have large front legs and look like tiny crabs. Females are larger than males. Nits hatch in about one week and the nymphs mature in about seven
days.</p>

<h5>Transmission</h5>
    <p>Lice are endemic in human populations, spreading through personal contact or contact with infested clothing or other personal items. They can be transmitted when unaffected clothing is stored with infested items. Among children head lice are
    commonly transmitted by the sharing of hats, combs, brushes, hair accessories, headphones, pillows, and stuffed toys . Pubic lice are sexually transmitted, although occasionally they can be transmitted through infested bedding, towels, or
    clothing. Lice do not jump, hop, or fly and they do not live on pets. Head lice cannot survive without a human host for more than a few days at most. Body lice can live without human contact for up to 10 days. Pubic lice can survive for one to
    two weeks without human contact. Head lice infestations are extremely common among children in schools, childcare facilities, camps,
    and playgrounds. They are the second most common communicable health problem in children, after the common cold , and appear to be on the increase. Some 6 to 12 million American children get head lice every year. In developing countries more than
    50 percent of the general population may be infested. Although anyone can get head lice, children aged three to ten and their families are most affected. Lice infestations are characterized by intense itching caused by an allergic reaction to a
    toxin in lice saliva. The itching can interfere with sleep and concentration. Repeated bites can lead to generalized skin eruptions or inflammation. Swelling or inflammation of the neck glands are common
    complications of head lice.</p>
    <h5>Prevention</h5>
<p>Prevention of lice infestation depends on adequate personal hygiene and consistently not sharing combs, brushes, hair accessories, hats, towels, or bedding. Hair should be checked weekly for lice and nits. Prevention includes sanitation and
sterilization of salon equipment and implements as directed
using an EPA approved product.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Sanitation and Disinfection in the Salon/School</h3>
<p>Each client has the potential of carrying some kind of bacterial or viral infection. It is necessary to regularly and consistently take the necessary steps to disinfect and decontaminate implements, linens, and surfaces in the salon. This is an
important service that salon owners provide to their clients and to their staff. Think of these practices as “risk elimination”.</p>

<h5>Sterilization/Disinfection/Sanitation The Differences</h5>
    <p>
    Sterilization is the destruction of all forms of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It is not necessary to practice sterilization in a salon atmosphere unless the skin barrier is penetrated or broken by use of a tool or implement.
<br>
    Disinfection is the process that eliminates many disease producing germs and organisms. The process of disinfection does not eliminate bacterial spores. Spores are the reproductive element and are more resistant. Spores can only be destroyed by
    sterilization.
<br>
    Sanitation is the process of making an object clean before disinfecting by means of hot water detergents, antibacterial soaps and sanitizers.
<br>
    Estheticians need to be concerned about fungi (a term for a group of yeasts and molds). Fungi can cause conditions such as athlete’s foot. Proper disinfecting of pedicure implements and foot basins can prevent the spread of infection. To
    simplify, use only stainless steel bowls and implements made of hard non-porous materials when possible.
<br>
    Hairdressers need to disinfect tools and other implements to prevent the spread of bacteria, plant parasites or fungi that can produce contagious diseases such as ringworm, favus (a skin disease of the scalp). Animal parasites such as head lice
    and itch mites cause scalp infections such as pediculosis and scabies.
<br>
    Make Up Artists need to be concerned with preventing cross contamination, infection and disease.
<br>
    Nail Technicians need to be concerned with fungi and bacterial diseases and the proper sanitation and disinfection procedures that help prevent the spread of diseases from one client to another.
<br>
    All foot spa systems must be drained, cleaned and disinfected between customers and at the end of each day.
</p>
<h5>How to Disinfect Implements</h5>
    <p>Implements such as scissors, combs, brushes, nail clippers, and files need to be disinfected after each use. (1) Sanitize the implements. (2) Place in clean disinfecting solution (see the list of approved disinfectants). (3) Submerse implements
    completely for 10 – 15 minutes or according to manufacturers’ directions. (4) Remove items by using basket lift or thongs. (5) rinse, dry and store in a clean, disinfected, dry, and covered container. Always follow the manufactures directions.
    Disinfectants are harmful to the skin and hair; proper removal from solution and rinsing is vital.


    Brushes must be disinfected after each use, to accommodate all services during the day. It may be necessary to invest in a sufficient number of brushes for busy days. This allows time for disinfected brushes to dry. This applies to hair brushes
    and brushes used in makeup applications. Salons with numerous operators may need to consider a central collection procedure for dirty brushes and implements.

    It may be useful to use disposable, single use items for esthetic services. Sponges, tissue, cotton, orange wood sticks, files, emery boards, applicators must be discarded after one use.
</p>
<h5>How to Disinfect a Surface</h5>
    <p>
    (1) Clean with suitable cleaner. (2) Apply disinfectant. (3) Leave disinfectant on for at least 10 minutes. (4) Wipe dry with clean damp cloth or paper towel.
</p>
<h5>Clean First, Then Disinfect & Sanitize</h5>

    <p>Cleaning and disinfecting are important steps for keeping everything healthy and safe.  Now that it’s time to implement those steps, you need to know which comes first. Disinfectant will only work on a clean
    item—so, make sure that you’re cleaning your tools with soap, water, and chemical-free cleaners first before you sanitize and disinfect. Don’t skip either of these steps!</p>

<h5>Liquid Disinfectant Needs to Be Changed Consistently</h5>
    <p>Though the standard is usually daily, if your disinfectant solution (you know, where you’re disinfecting your tools) becomes cloudy or has any debris floating in it, you need to change your disinfectant. Our best advice? Change your disinfectant
    between every single client to ensure you’re keeping them as safe as possible.
</p>

    <h5>Know Your Contact Times For Each of Your Tools</h5>
    <p>Every tool, piece of equipment, and surface is different, so know your contact times for each. Contact time is how long a particular tool must be in disinfectant or stay visibly wet with the disinfectant to destroy the pathogens on it. When it
    comes to immersions or sprays, the time is typically 10 minutes. Wipes usually require 2-4 minutes.</p>

<h5>Check Your Disinfectants—Are They Effective?</h5>
    <p>Not every disinfectant is created equally, so it’s important that you’re checking the stats on the one you’re using. IS your disinfectant EPA-registered? Is your disinfectant of choice labeled as viricidal? Is it labeled as bactericidal or
    fungicidal?</p>

<h5>Sanitize After Every Use</h5>
    <p>This one goes without saying, but you absolutely need to sanitize all of your tools after every client. For your combs, brushes, tweezers, clippers, and more, you need to wash them with soap and water, and then totally submerge the in a wet
    sanitizer for the approved time. If you wore rubber gloves, a cape, a towel – anything that even potentially touched a client – you need to either dispose of or sanitize right away! Never use a tool on someone that hasn’t been properly sanitized.
    Store all of your sanitized tools in a dry, sanitary storage container.
</p>
<h5>Go for Gloves and PPE</h5>
<p>  This is not required by law (in most states, but it does vary), but it can be a helpful way to show your clients you care about sanitation. Check to see if your client has any latex allergies before use, but if you feel so inclined, use gloves
  while you work on your clients. They’ll probably appreciate the extra step toward sanitation and cleanliness, and they’ll certainly take note of your efforts.
</p>
<h5>Try to Use Single-Use Items Where You Can</h5>
  <p>While it’s not possible to buy everything as a single-use item (I mean, as nice as it would be to buy a new set of makeup brushes for every client, it’s just not feasible for anyone), there are some items that you can buy that are single-use.
  This will help with sanitation, cleanliness, and safety. For example, if you can swing disposable towels, gloves, or neck strips, that might be a great addition to your sanitation checklist.
</p>

    <h5>Get Recertified & Specialized</h5>
<p>Keeping up on your sanitation certification is a huge deal! Even if the state you work in doesn’t require you to re-up your cert yearly, we recommend doing so as often as possible. Why? Because practices evolve and change. It’s your job to always
be on top of the best ways to sanitize and disinfect properly. Check out certification courses from big names like Barbicide—they even have a COVID-19 certification course that goes over short-term guidelines for keeping your salon safe.
</p>

  <h5>Set an Occupancy Limit</h5>
  <p> We know how tempting it might be to fit in as many clients as possible. Mostly because it’s likely you really missed your regulars, but also, let’s not pretend it’s not going to be nice to get your income back. One of the biggest aspects of
      reopening in a safe way is ensuring you’re putting the least amount of people at risk at a time. In other words, don’t just let anyone walk into your salon to request an appointment and don’t pack out the salon with clients. Try to set up a
      super-cautious occupancy limit that allows a set number of people and workers in a space at a time. Try to ensure this limit allows for plenty of social distancing and doesn’t make anyone feel crowded. This number is going to vary based on your
      individual salon, but we recommend making sure that number is based on safety and security and less on trying to serve as many clients as possible—even though they’ve been without you for weeks.
</p>

    <h5>Get Rid of Waiting Areas</h5>
    <p>Typically, the waiting room or waiting area in a salon is, like, the place to be. And while we all probably truly love and cherish that community we’ve built in our own salons because of it, choosing to forgo it at this time is a really great way
    to keep everyone safe. Set up a system with your clients where they call in before they enter the building to make sure you’re ready for their appointment. Try to avoid the whole “waiting in the salon” aspect altogether. Get your clients in, get
    them out, and get them looking fabulous with the least amount of exposure possible.
</p>

    <h5>Be Firm on Social Distancing</h5>
  <p>  Yes, you’re going to want to hug your clients. Yes, you’re going to want to pal around with your colleagues. And yes, you’re going to want to go back to life as normal. But it’s important to put everyone’s best interest first and stick to the
    social distancing as best as you possibly can. That means when you’re able to stay up to 6+ ft apart, you probably should. We’re not saying you need to stand on opposite sides of the room and shout at your coworkers, but if it’s possible, stagger
    your stylist chairs, leave lots of open space, open windows and doors for fresh air, and most of all, encourage your clients to follow suit.
</p>

    <h5>Remove Communal Treat Bowls</h5>
    <p>We’re sure you already know to do this, but it doesn’t hurt to throw a little reminder in here. As stylists, it’s always fun (not to mention important) to make our clients feel welcome, pampered, and cherished—and often that comes in the form of
    candy bowls, unlimited coffee, and maybe even a delicious alcoholic drink (who doesn’t love a good adult beverage, right?) But for the time being, we suggest stepping away from this form of client appreciation. We’re sure everyone will miss the
    bowls of Godiva, but the less stuff you have around for communal touching, the better.
</p>
<h5>Sanitize, Disinfect, and Sanitize Again</h5>
    <p>We know, we know, you’ve always been a clean salon, shop, or spa—but now’s the time to not just get even more serious about your cleanliness, but to showcase that dedication to your clients. Make sure your clients know your policy and procedure
    on sanitizing and disinfecting equipment—in fact, don’t be afraid to put up signs or explain it to each client individually as they come in for their appointments.
</p>

    <h5>Sanitation</h5>

    <p>We sanitize in order to make a surface, our hands, a tool, etcetera, clean and safe for use. Sanitation is an absolute necessity. When we sanitize, we kill the single-cell microorganisms we call bacteria. There are trillions of bacteria, and not
    all are bad. Non-pathogenic bacteria are harmless and beneficial, but pathogenic bacteria are harmful and can cause infection. For this reason, a clean working environment is imperative, as is following sanitation requirements learned in beauty
    school, such as washing hands and fingernails with an antibacterial soap. Keep in mind that sanitation will not destroy all spores and viruses, which is where heavy duty disinfecting and sterilizing come in. To make our hands sanitary we need to
    wash them for 20 seconds with soap (preferably antibacterial) and water as hot as can be comfortably tolerated. </p>


    <h5>Disinfection</h5>

    <p>To disinfect something is to render it free from pathogenic organisms or to make them inert. That is, to kill the germs and bacteria or to render them harmless.
    To keep you and your client safe, any item that touches a customer must be disinfected before it can be used on any other customer. Most disinfectors kill 99.99% of germs within 30 seconds. When you disinfect you are removing potentially harmful
    bacteria that might not be visible to the naked eye. You can disinfect tools by soaking them in alcohol, quats, or a phenol compound such as Barbicide for at least ten minutes (see recommended instructions for products used). Most disinfection
    solutions are weakened or rendered inactive by contamination of organic material such as skin or nail dust. They should be replaced daily or according to manufacturers directions. We also recommend disinfecting tables, handles, magnifier lamps,
    doorknobs, sinks and dispensers between clients.</p>


    <h5>Sterilization</h5>
    <p>Sterilization is the removal of all microorganisms and other pathogens from a surface or object by subjecting it to high heat or pressure such as an autoclave. When we sterilize, we completely eliminate microbial viability, killing all
    non-pathogenic and pathogenic spores, fungi and viruses. In the salon, sterilization is not really necessary. This process is only required on instruments entering the body cavity. This procedure is normally used in the medical and dental field.
    Some salons, however, do use heat or pressure to sterilize metal instruments.
    For sterilizing purposes, we recommend an autoclave, and for smaller spaces a glass bead sterilizer. Always sterilize areas that come into contact with blood or other bodily fluids. Instruments and tools such as tweezers and scissors should be
    stored in a covered container after being sterilized until you’re ready to use them.</p>

    <h5>Eyelash Extension Application Tool Sterilizer</h5>
<p>Give your customers peace of mind knowing that all of your eyelash extension tools are sterilized with a quality sterilizer.
</p>
    <h5>More Tips for in the Salon</h5>
    <p>If you are unfamiliar with Universal Precautions, or state guidelines, all information is researchable online. Do not apply eyelash or eyebrow extensions unless you are clear about these basic, but extremely important principles. I recommend
    using disposable items whenever possible, such as spoolies, flocking applicators, Q-tips, micro brushes, under eye gel patches, medical tape, glue rings, glue trays and table paper. Disposable items must be thrown away immediately after use.
</p>

    <h3>Steam Sterilization</h3>
    <p>
    Of all the methods available for sterilization, moist heat in the form of saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive 826, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and
    rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics (Table 6) 827. Like all sterilization processes, steam sterilization has some deleterious effects on some materials, including corrosion and combustion of lubricants associated with dental handpieces212;
    reduction in ability to transmit light associated with laryngoscopes828; and increased hardening time (5.6 fold) with plaster-cast 829.
<br>
    The basic principle of steam sterilization, as accomplished in an autoclave, is to expose each item to direct steam contact at the required temperature and pressure for the specified time. Thus, there are four parameters of steam sterilization:
    steam, pressure, temperature, and time. The ideal steam for sterilization is dry saturated steam and entrained water (dryness fraction ≥97%).813, 819 Pressure serves as a means to obtain the high temperatures necessary to quickly kill
    microorganisms. Specific temperatures must be obtained to ensure the microbicidal activity. The two common steam-sterilizing temperatures are 121°C (250°F) and 132°C (270°F). These temperatures (and other high temperatures)830 must be maintained
    for a minimal time to kill microorganisms. Recognized minimum exposure periods for sterilization of wrapped healthcare supplies are 30 minutes at 121°C (250°F) in a gravity displacement sterilizer or 4 minutes at 132°C (270°F) in a prevacuum
    sterilizer (Table 7). At constant temperatures, sterilization times vary depending on the type of item (e.g., metal versus rubber, plastic, items with lumens), whether the item is wrapped or unwrapped, and the sterilizer type.
<br>
    The two basic types of steam sterilizers (autoclaves) are the gravity displacement autoclave and the high-speed prevacuum sterilizer. In the former, steam is admitted at the top or the sides of the sterilizing chamber and, because the steam is
    lighter than air, forces air out the bottom of the chamber through the drain vent. The gravity displacement autoclaves are primarily used to process laboratory media, water, pharmaceutical products, regulated medical waste, and nonporous articles
    whose surfaces have direct steam contact. For gravity displacement sterilizers the penetration time into porous items is prolonged because of incomplete air elimination. This point is illustrated with the decontamination of 10 lbs of
    microbiological waste, which requires at least 45 minutes at 121°C because the entrapped air remaining in a load of waste greatly retards steam permeation and heating efficiency.831, 832 The high-speed prevacuum sterilizers are similar to the
    gravity displacement sterilizers except they are fitted with a vacuum pump (or ejector) to ensure air removal from the sterilizing chamber and load before the steam is admitted. The advantage of using a vacuum pump is that there is nearly
    instantaneous steam penetration even into porous loads. The Bowie-Dick test is used to detect air leaks and inadequate air removal and consists of folded 100% cotton surgical towels that are clean and preconditioned. A commercially available
    Bowie-Dick-type test sheet should be placed in the center of the pack. The test pack should be placed horizontally in the front, bottom section of the sterilizer rack, near the door and over the drain, in an otherwise empty chamber and run at
    134°C for 3.5 minutes.813, 819 The test is used each day the vacuum-type steam sterilizer is used, before the first processed load. Air that is not removed from the chamber will interfere with steam contact. Smaller disposable test packs (or
    process challenge devices) have been devised to replace the stack of folded surgical towels for testing the efficacy of the vacuum system in a prevacuum sterilizer.833 These devices are “designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to
    constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process.”819, 834 They should be representative of the load and simulate the greatest challenge to the load.835 Sterilizer vacuum performance is acceptable if the sheet inside the test pack
    shows a uniform color change. Entrapped air will cause a spot to appear on the test sheet, due to the inability of the steam to reach the chemical indicator. If the sterilizer fails the Bowie-Dick test, do not use the sterilizer until it is
    inspected by the sterilizer maintenance personnel and passes the Bowie-Dick test.
<br>
    Another design in steam sterilization is a steam flush-pressure pulsing process, which removes air rapidly by repeatedly alternating a steam flush and a pressure pulse above atmospheric pressure. Air is rapidly removed from the load as with the
    prevacuum sterilizer, but air leaks do not affect this process because the steam in the sterilizing chamber is always above atmospheric pressure. Typical sterilization temperatures and times are 132°C to 135°C with 3 to 4 minutes exposure time
    for porous loads and instruments. Like other sterilization systems, the steam cycle is monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological monitors. Steam sterilizers usually are monitored using a printout (or graphically) by measuring temperature,
    the time at the temperature, and pressure. Typically, chemical indicators are affixed to the outside and incorporated into the pack to monitor the temperature or time and temperature. The effectiveness of steam sterilization is monitored with a
    biological indicator containing spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus). Positive spore test results are a relatively rare event 838 and can be attributed to operator error, inadequate steam delivery,839 or
    equipment malfunction.
<br>
    Portable (table-top) steam sterilizers are used in outpatient, dental, and rural clinics.840 These sterilizers are designed for small instruments, such as hypodermic syringes and needles and dental instruments. The ability of the sterilizer to
    reach physical parameters necessary to achieve sterilization should be monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators. The oldest and most recognized agent for inactivation of microorganisms is heat. D-values (time to reduce the
    surviving population by 90% or 1 log10) allow a direct comparison of the heat resistance of microorganisms. Because a D-value can be determined at various temperatures, a subscript is used to designate the exposure temperature (i.e., D121C).
    D121C-values for Geobacillus stearothermophilus used to monitor the steam sterilization process range from 1 to 2 minutes. Heat-resistant nonspore-forming bacteria, yeasts, and fungi have such low D121C values that they cannot be experimentally
    measured.841
<br>
    Moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins. In support of this fact, it has been found that the presence of moisture significantly affects the coagulation temperature of
    proteins and the temperature at which microorganisms are destroyed.
</p>
<h5>Uses</h5>
    <p>Steam sterilization should be used whenever possible on all critical and semicritical items that are heat and moisture resistant (e.g., steam sterilizable respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment), even when not essential to prevent pathogen
    transmission. Steam sterilizers also are used in healthcare facilities to decontaminate microbiological waste and sharps containers 831, 832, 842 but additional exposure time is required in the gravity displacement sterilizer for these items.
</p>
<h3>Autoclave</h3>

    <h5>What is autoclave sterilization?</h5>
    <p>The simplest explanation is that it is a highly effective method of sterilizing and disinfecting objects through the use of heat — in the form of steam — plus pressure and time. In an autoclave, objects or
   instruments that have been exposed to contaminants such as microorganisms, spores or biological material are placed in a chamber. The machine is then pressurized and filled with steam. This pressure raises the temperature of the steam to the
   required level — typically between 121° C and 134° C — and ensures that every part of the instrument can be sterilized by maintaining the pressure and temperature for a predetermined amount of time.
</p>

    <h5>Purpose of an Autoclave</h5>
    <p>Autoclaves were developed to clean tools that could not be sterilized with heat or detergents alone. Thanks to the pressurization component of the process, an autoclave can reach steam temperatures higher than normal, which allows them to operate
    relatively quickly and decontaminate all parts of an instrument. In addition, today’s autoclaves easily facilitate verification of the procedure using temperature-sensitive tape and other indicators. An autoclave is most frequently used in
    medical centers and hospitals, dental offices, laboratories, and research facilities. It is also useful, however, in any scenario where reusable equipment must be sterilized. Businesses such as food and beverage proprietors, veterinarians and
    even barbershops or beauty salons could benefit from an autoclave.</p>


    <h5>Autoclave Process</h5>
    <p>Autoclaves generally follows these steps:
<ul>
  <li>Objects or instruments (also called load materials) to be sterilized are placed in an autoclave-compatible bag and then into a secondary container. This will help prevent contact with the walls of the autoclave, which could melt plastic
  components</li>
<li>Once packaged, the vessel is placed in the autoclave</li>
<li>The operator closes and locks the autoclave, then selects the correct cycle for the type of material to be sterilized</li>
<li>The autoclave is pressurized, fills with steam, and begins to approach the specified temperature for the cycle</li>
<li>Once it reaches the sterilization temperature the autoclave will keep the chamber at that temperature for the full sterilization cycle duration</li>
<li>Operators should confirm that the required temperature is consistently met for the entire duration of the sterilization period</li>
<li>  Once the cycle is complete, the autoclave will enter a cooling mode where it will slowly depressurize and return to room temperature. Many autoclaves won’t open until their internal temperature reaches a safe level</li>
<li>Check any verification measures, such as temperature tape</li>
<li>Remove the tools and let stand in a designated “hot zone” until cooled to room temperature, then transport as needed</li>

</ul>
</p>

  <h5>What makes up a sterilization cycle?</h5>

  <p>Each sterilization cycle has various parameters associated with it. These are typically based around a specific
    load configuration or material type. The parameters the autoclave uses are: pressure, temperature, and time.</p>

    <h5>How long does an autoclave take to sterilize?</h5>
  <p>  In general, each cycle will take between 60 to 90 minutes. The sterilization duration varies, but is typically around 30 minutes, and the remaining cycle time is split between heating up and cooling down the chamber.
</p>

    <h5>On what is an autoclave effective?</h5>
    <p>The sterilization process kills bacteria, viruses and bacterial spores. Biological indicators and lethality calculations can be used to validate a cycle for an autoclave.
</p>

    <h5>Can the process fail?</h5>
    <p>It can, for a variety of reasons. Read on to learn why and what to do in such a circumstance.
</p>
    <h5>What to Do if an Autoclave Fails</h5>
    <p>An autoclave can be unsuccessful for a number of reasons, most commonly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improper calibration of the machine, leading to temperature or pressure fluctuation</li>
      <li>Incorrect cycle selection for the load materials, or using a non-validated cycle</li>
      <li>Low-quality steam, or vapor that is too high in water content or has been heated beyond the most efficient temperature for the autoclave (generally 134° C)</li>
      <li>Improper packaging or positioning of materials to be sterilized</li>
    </ul>

<p>  Modern autoclaves include verification measures such as temperature-sensitive and/or chemical-indicator tapes, control vials containing biological contaminants and more. By confirming the success of sterilization, operators and facilities can
  easily detect whether maintenance, CALIBRATION or other measures are needed to service the equipment. Many autoclaves come with pre-validated cycles that are proven by the manufacturer to sterilize certain types of loads. Custom cycles can also
  be validated by the end users for process specific materials and loads.

    <h1>Chapter 3: OSHA</h1>

    OSHA COVID-19 Guidance for Hair and Nail Salon Services
    OSHA is committed to protecting the health and safety of America’s workers and workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency is issuing a series of industry-specific alerts to help keep workers safe.

    The following steps can help reduce employee risk of exposure to the
    coronavirus in hair and nail salons:
    -Instruct sick workers to stay home.
    -Have a qualified ventilation professional evaluate the building’s
    HVAC system.
    -Provide and have all workers wear face coverings (i.e., cloth face
    coverings or surgical masks) that have at least two layers of tightly woven breathable fabric, unless
    their work task requires a respirator. Face coverings should be provided at no cost to workers.
    -Instruct customers to wear face coverings during service.
    -Implement physical distancing practices for customers awaiting services, such as instructing customers to wait outside or in their cars until their appointments.
    -Wash and dry customers’ hair before performing any other services and require nail clients to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer before proceeding.
    -Use pre-pay systems or self-checkout procedures and provide hand sanitizer at the point of purchase.
    -Emphasize washing hands with soap and water to both workers and customers.
    -Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces, tools and equipment.
    -Do not allow the sharing of tools and equipment between workers. If sharing cannot be eliminated, clean and disinfect between each use.
    -Ensure policies encourage workers to report any safety and health concerns.

    OSHA & Formaldehyde
    OSHA has found that some hair smoothing products may contain formaldehyde, may release formaldehyde at levels above OSHA's permissible limits during use, and may be mislabeled, all of which can pose health risks to salon workers. Salons and other
    employers, such as beauty schools, that use hair smoothing products that contain or may release formaldehyde must follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards.

    OSHA measured unsafe levels of formaldehyde in the air at three salons using specific products and issued citations to the salon owners for failing to protect workers from over exposure to formaldehyde. OSHA also issued citations and fines to
    salons and other employers (e.g., beauty schools) for using products that contained or could release formaldehyde and failing to follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde standard (e.g., testing the air to determine formaldehyde levels,
    providing protective equipment, providing training). In addition, OSHA tested and found formaldehyde in several products that were labeled "formaldehyde free" or did not list formaldehyde on the label. OSHA cited the manufacturers and
    distributors of these products for incorrectly labeling the products.

    While this webpage highlights information and data that OSHA has on formaldehyde in hair smoothing products, other products used in the salon may also contain or release formaldehyde. The information on this webpage applies all salon products
    that contain or may release formaldehyde. Salon owners, stylists, and other salon workers have the right know what is in the products that they are buying and using and how to protect their workers and themselves from formaldehyde exposure. If
    salon owners decide to use products that contain or could release formaldehyde, then they must follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards.

    Formaldehyde Levels Found in Hair Salons
    Hair products may contain or release a chemical called formaldehyde. In 2011, Federal OSHA found that stylists in three salons using either Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution or Cadiveu Brasil Cacau were exposed to
    formaldehyde above OSHA's 15-minute short term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 parts formaldehyde per million parts air (ppm), putting their health at risk (see graphic). In one salon, formaldehyde levels during the blow drying phase of treatment were
    measured at five times the OSHA STEL. All three salons were issued OSHA citations and two were issued fines for failing to protect workers from the health risks of formaldehyde. In addition, OSHA issued citations and fines to other salons using
    products that contained or could release formaldehyde because they did not follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde standard to test the air to determine formaldehyde levels and to provide workers training and information on the health
    hazards and signs and symptoms of exposure to formaldehyde. Federal OSHA issued additional citations to 37 salons (including beauty schools) and 9 distributors/manufacturers in fiscal years (FY) 2011 and 2012.

    Based on air testing and product sampling, OSHA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), California OSHA, and the California Department of Public Health have all issued warnings and/or citations to smoothing product manufacturers for
    violating rules for formaldehyde labeling. Oregon OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have also found that certain hair smoothing products contain or release formaldehyde. The Connecticut Department of
    Public Health, New York State Health Department, and Health Canada have also issued health warnings to salons and consumers about formaldehyde in hair smoothing products.

    Health Risks of Formaldehyde
    In June 2011, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review's Expert Panel revised its Tentative Amended Safety Assessment for formaldehyde and methylene glycol. The revised assessment states, in part, that "formaldehyde and methylene glycol are unsafe for use
    in hair smoothing products, the use of which involves application of high temperatures."

    If you work with hair products that contain formaldehyde, you can be exposed to the chemical by:

    -Breathing it in through your nose and mouth
    -Getting it on your skin
    -Getting it in your eyes or mouth

    Formaldehyde is a known cancer-causing substance. Exposure to formaldehyde can also cause:

    -Eye irritation and damage, including blindness.
    -Nose irritation, including bloody noses.
    -Skin sensitivity, rashes, and itching.
    -Breathing difficulties, such as coughing and wheezing.
    -Levels of formaldehyde above 0.1 ppm in the air can irritate your nose, throat, and lungs. These symptoms will get worse as formaldehyde levels go up.

    For more information about formaldehyde, the hazards it presents, and related standards and requirements, visit Protecting Worker Health and OSHA's formaldehyde page

    In October 2011, the consulting firm ChemRisk, LLC published a study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene that also found that some hair-smoothing products, including some labeled formaldehyde-free, contain formaldehyde and
    could expose workers and customers to formaldehyde at levels above OSHA's short term exposure limit (STEL). ChemRisk's tests showed that Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution contained 11.5% formaldehyde, Global Keratin Juvexin
    Optimized Functional Keratin contained 8.3% formaldehyde, and Coppola Keratin Complex Blonde Formula contained 3% formaldehyde. Of these, only Global Keratin lists formaldehyde on its label. However, the Global Keratin label indicated it
    contained less than 4% formaldehyde, less than half of what was found in the product during testing. ChemRisk also tested the air while a stylist performed a simulated treatment process using each product. Formaldehyde was found in the air during
    all three simulations. During the simulation with Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution, formaldehyde levels were above OSHA's 15-minute STEL during blow drying

    How to Know if Products Contain or Release Formaldehyde
    Formaldehyde is a strong-smelling gas used in many products. Hair products may have formaldehyde dissolved (and chemically reacted) in water and often the reacted formaldehyde is called methylene glycol.

    Even smoothing products that do not list formaldehyde on the label, or that claim to be "formaldehyde free" or "no formaldehyde," can still expose workers to formaldehyde. Some products violate regulations by not listing their formaldehyde
    content on the label, and some contain other substances that can release formaldehyde during use, typically when the product is heated, such as during flat-ironing or blow-drying.

    Under OSHA standards, all of these substances are subject to the same rules as formaldehyde. When they are present in products above certain levels, OSHA requires formaldehyde hazards to be listed on labels and in material safety data sheets
    (MSDSs), documents that explain the health hazards of products that contain hazardous chemicals and the recommended safe practices for working with them. OSHA has cited several manufacturers and distributors for incorrectly labeling their
    products "formaldehyde-free" or by not including formaldehyde on the label when it was in the product.

    OSHA has identified several brand-name products that contain formaldehyde or that can expose you to formaldehyde during use, even though they may not list formaldehyde on their labels or MSDSs:

    Brazilian Blowout
    Acai Professional Smoothing Solution (FDA Warning Letter)
    Professional Brazilian Blowout Solution
    Cadiveu
    Brasil Cacau
    Acai Therapy
    Copomon/Coppola
    Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy
    Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment
    Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment Blonde
    Express Blow Out
    Marcia Teixeira
    Brazilian Keratin Treatment
    Advanced Brazilian Keratin Treatment
    Chocolate Extreme De-Frizzing Treatment
    Soft Gentle Smoothing Treatment
    Soft Chocolate Gentle Smoothing Treatment

    Oregon OSHA's report on Hair Smoothing Products and ChemRisk, LLC's journal article include the names of additional products that have been shown to contain formaldehyde.

    Bottles of Brazilian Blowout Acai Smoothing Solution and Brazilian Blowout Professional Smoothing Solution must have "CAUTION" stickers on the bottles to warn users of potential exposure to formaldehyde gas and the need for precautionary
    measures. Formaldehyde or methylene glycol must also be prominently identified in an ingredient list on the bottle. These actions are part of a settlement reached between the distributor, GIB LLC, and the State of California that was announced on
    January 30, 2012.

    Protecting Worker Health: What OSHA Requires
    When possible, salon owners, beauty schools, and workers should avoid using products containing formaldehyde, methylene glycol, other ingredients that are treated as formaldehyde under OSHA regulations. Hair product companies are now making and
    selling products that they claim do not contain formaldehyde in the solution. Choosing one of these products can help to reduce the risk of exposure to formaldehyde. Check the labels or MSDSs to see what chemicals products contain, but remember
    companies do not always properly list formaldehyde on labels.

    If salon owners decide to use products that may contain or release formaldehyde, then they must follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards to protect worker safety. Requirements include steps such as testing
    salon air during treatments to determine formaldehyde levels, providing adequate ventilation and appropriate personal protective equipment for workers performing treatments, and training workers on the hazards of formaldehyde. Failure to follow
    the requirements of the formaldehyde and hazard communication standards has consequences. In FY2011 and FY2012, Federal OSHA issued citations to 40 salons (including beauty schools) and 9 distributors/manufacturers with fines as high as $17,500
    for failing to protect workers from over exposure and potential exposures to formaldehyde, including:

    -Failure to protect workers from over exposures to formaldehyde,
    -Failure to protect workers from possible exposure to formaldehyde, and
    -Failure to provide workers with information about other hazardous chemicals, besides formaldehyde.

    Salon workers should also be familiar with the contents of the products they use, the hazards those products present, and the steps they can take to help reduce their exposure to formaldehyde, such as wearing protective equipment and properly
    cleaning up spills.

    Salon owners and workers can request the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, at no cost, to help identify and correct any health hazard in the workplace through its Health Hazard Evaluation Program. Contact NIOSH at
    1-800-CDC-INFO [1-800-232-4636].


    Chapter 4: Workman's Compensation in Florida

    Workman's Compensation
    Workers' compensation or workers' comp is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her
    employer for the tort of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as "the compensation bargain". One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is
    the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that, and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers.
    While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of
    medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment. General damage for pain and suffering, and punitive damages for employer negligence,
    are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case.

    How Does Workers’ Compensation Work in Florida?
    Florida Workers’ Compensation Exemption If your employees have a job-related injury or illness, your workers’ compensation insurance can help pay for important benefits like medical expenses. This includes care for repetitive stress injuries, and
    ongoing treatments, like physical therapy. This coverage also helps replace lost wages if you have injured workers who need time off to recover from a work-related injury or illness. It can also help cover a permanent disability that keeps your
    employee from returning to work. It’ll even help cover funeral costs if a job-related accident causes the death of an employee.

    Workers' Compensation Insurance
    Workers' compensation insurance is coverage purchased by the employer/business that provides benefits for job-related employee injuries, with a few exceptions. Florida law requires most employers to purchase workers' compensation coverage. Under
    a workers' compensation policy, employees are compensated for occupationally incurred injuries, regardless of fault. This coverage makes employers immune from some injury lawsuits by employees.
    The Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) provides important oversight for those writing workers’ compensation coverage in Florida. OIR regulates the rates, forms and financial solvency for workers’ compensation insurers as part of its mission to
    maintain a robust and competitive market and maintain protections for the insurance-buying public. In Florida, the Division of Workers' Compensation within the Department of Financial Services (DFS) is the primary regulator for ensuring employees
    receive the proper benefits under this coverage, which includes benefits for medical expenses, disability, or death.

    Workers' Compensation Market
    There are more than 250 insurers offering workers’ compensation insurance in the state of Florida. In Florida, the largest workers’ compensation insurer is a private market insurer rather than a state-created residual market entity.

    How Much Are Workers' Compensation Benefits in Florida?
    A work injury can cause major disruptions to your life—not only to your health, but also to your career, finances, and overall well-being. The Florida workers' compensation system is designed to compensate you for some of those losses and help
    you get back to work as soon as possible. (To get the benefits described below, you will need to file a Florida workers' compensation claim and show that your injury or illness is work related.)

    Can You Get Workers' Comp Benefits in Florida for COVID-19?
    In Florida, you may receive workers' comp benefits if you contracted an occupational disease while you were working, but only if the illness resulted from the particular nature of your job—meaning that your job presented a hazard that was
    different than the "usual run of occupations," or that the incidence of the disease is substantially higher than usual in your job. Under a directive from the Florida government, "frontline" state employees (whose jobs require in-person
    interactions with the public) should receive workers' comp benefits for COVID-19, regardless of other potential causes of the illness. Unlike several other states, Florida has not enacted measures that specifically make it easier for other
    employees in high-risk jobs to get workers' comp benefits for COVID-19 without having to prove that they contracted the illness at work. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation did issue a memorandum reminding insurers that first responders,
    healthcare workers, and others that contract COVID-19 due to work-related exposure would be eligible for benefits under state law. However, it still would be up to these employees to provide evidence showing that they got sick because of exposure
    at work rather than in the rest of their lives.

    Temporary Disability Benefits
    Under Florida workers' comp, you'll be eligible for temporary total disability benefits if you need time away from work to recover from your work-related injury or illness. You won't get these benefits for the first seven days off, unless your
    injury keeps you from working for more than 21 days. Temporary total disability benefits are two-thirds of your average weekly wage just before the injury, up to a legal maximum that's adjusted annually. For injuries in 2020, the maximum is $971
    per week. (To see the caps for other years, check out this table of maximum benefits amounts on the website for Florida's Division of Workers' Compensation.) For some severe injuries like paralysis or blindness, the benefit rate is higher: 80% of
    the employee's pre-injury wages for the first six months, without a maximum. The legal minimum is $20 per week.

    Temporary total disability benefits will continue until the earliest of three events:

    -your doctor says you can go back to work
    -your doctor says that your condition won't improve, even with further medical treatment (a stage called "maximum medical improvement," or MMI)
    -you've reached the maximum amount of time for temporary disability benefits.

    Florida law says that temporarily disabled workers may not receive these benefits for more than two years (Fla. Stat. Ann. § 440.14). However, the state's supreme court has found that the 104-week limit is unconstitutional when it's applied to
    cut off benefits for someone who has hit that limit but hasn't reached MMI and is still totally disabled; the court said that the appropriate fix would be to apply the previous 260-week limit in that situation (Westphal v. City of St. Petersburg,
    194 So.3d 311 (Fla. 2016)). You may receive temporary partial disability benefits if your condition hasn't reached MMI but your doctor has said that you can return to work with some restrictions (such as not lifting heavy objects or using a
    keyboard for limited periods). If you earn less when working with these restrictions than you did before, these benefits will be 80% of the difference between your current earnings and 80% of your pre-injury wages. For example, suppose you used
    to earn $1,000 a week but now earn $600. You would subtract $600 from 80% of $1,000 (or $800), to get $200. You would then receive 80% of $200, or $160 per week.

    Permanent Impairment Benefits
    Once your medical treatment is complete (or six weeks before your temporary total disability benefits are set to expire if you haven't yet reached the MMI stage), your doctor will evaluate you to determine whether you have any lasting medical
    condition or lost function (called an "impairment") as a result of your injury. If you can work to some extent, the doctor will use a schedule to assign you an impairment rating, expressed as a percentage. This rating will then be used to
    calculate how long your permanent impairment benefits will last, according to a formula in Florida law. The amount of the weekly benefits will be 75% of your temporary total disability rate (up to the same legal maximum), but that amount will be
    cut in half if you're earning at least as much as you did before your injury. If you know your impairment rating, you can use Florida's handy impairment benefits calculator to figure out how much you'll receive each week and for how long.

    Permanent Total Disability Benefits
    If your doctor finds you have a permanent disability that keeps you from doing any work (even a sedentary job), you will be eligible to receive permanent total disability benefits at the same rate as your temporary total disability benefits.
    These benefits will continue until you're 75 years old (or for the rest of your life if you don't qualify for Social Security benefits). Certain severe injuries—such as amputation of an arm or leg or severe brain injury—are automatically
    considered to cause permanent total disability.

    Additional Benefits
    Florida workers' compensation also provides additional benefits, including:

    -Medical benefits. Workers' comp pays for all medical care that's necessary to treat a work-related injury or illness, as long as your treatment is prescribed by the treating doctor and authorized by the insurance company. You're also entitled to
    the cost of traveling to and from doctor's appointments and to get prescribed medicine. (For more information, see our article on how to get medical treatment through workers' comp.)

    -Vocational rehabilitation. If you can't return to your normal job, you may receive placement services, vocational counseling, and other help to find new employment. If you need additional training or education to get a suitable job, workers'
    comp may pay for that education, but only for 26 or 52 weeks.

    -Death Benefits. When an employee dies as a result of a work-related injury or illness, the worker's spouse, children, or other dependent relatives can receive death benefits. The amount of the benefit depends on how many dependents there are,
    but it cannot be more than two-thirds of the worker's average weekly wage (up to the same limits that apply to temporary total disability benefits) or $150,000 in total. Workers' comp will also pay up to $7,500 for funeral and burial expenses.

    Limitations of Workers' Comp Benefits
    As you can see, workers' comp pays only a portion of your lost wages (although it helps that workers' comp benefits are generally tax-free). In addition, you can't receive any compensation for the pain and suffering caused by your injury. While
    this may seem unfair, it's part of the trade-off in the workers' comp system. The advantage is that you can get benefits relatively quickly without needing to file a lawsuit or prove that your employer was at fault for causing your injury. The
    downside is that you can't get the full value of your losses. (In some limited situations, however, you may be able to file a lawsuit outside of the workers' comp system to seek compensation for your losses, including pain and suffering.)

    purpose of recharging, rechargeable clippers may be stored in an area other than in a closed cabinet or container, provided such area is clean and provided the cutting edges of such clippers have been disinfected.

    f) Ultraviolet Irradiation may be used to store articles and instruments after they have been cleansed and disinfected.

    g) Pedicure Equipment Disinfection: The following cleaning and disinfection procedures must be used for any pedicure equipment that holds water, including sinks, bowls, basins, pipe-less spas, and whirlpool spas:
    1. After each client, all pedicure units must be cleaned with a low-foaming soap or detergent with water to remove all visible debris, then disinfected with an EPA registered hospital grade bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and pseudomonacidal
    disinfectant used according to manufacturer’s instructions for at least ten (10) minutes. If the pipe-free foot spa has a foot plate, it should be removed and the area beneath it cleaned, rinsed, and wiped dry.
    2. At the end of each day of use, the following procedures shall be used: a. All filter screens in whirlpool pedicure spas or basins for all types of foot spas must be disinfected. All visible debris in the screen and the inlet must be removed
    and cleaned with a low-foaming soap or detergent and water. For pipe-free systems, the jet components or foot plate must be removed and cleaned, and any debris removed. The screen, jet, or foot plate must be completely immersed in an EPA
    registered, hospital grade bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and pseudomonacidal disinfectant that is used according to manufacturer’s instructions. The screen, jet, or foot plate must be replaced after disinfection is completed and the system
    is flushed with warm water and low-foaming soap for 5 minutes, rinsed, and drained. b. After the above procedures are completed, the basin should be filled with clean water and the correct amount of EPA registered disinfectant. The solution must
    be circulated through foot spa system for 10 minutes and the unit then turned off. The solution should remain in the basin for at least 6 to 10 hours. Before using the equipment again, the basin system must be drained and flushed with clean
    water.
    3. Once each week, subsequent to completing the required end-of-day cleaning procedures, the basin must be filled with a solution of water containing one teaspoon of 5.25% bleach for each gallon of water. The solution must be circulated through
    the spa system for 5 to 10 minutes and then the solution must sit in the basin for at least 6 hours. Before use, the system must be drained and flushed. 4. A record or logbook containing the dates and times of all pedicure cleaning and
    disinfection procedures must be documented and kept in the pedicure area by the salon and made available for review upon request by a consumer or a Department inspector.

    4) No cosmetology or specialty salon shall be operated in the same licensed space allocation with any other business which adversely affects the sanitation of the salon, or in the same licensed space allocation with a school teaching cosmetology
    or a specialty licensed under Chapter 477, F.S., or in any other location, space, or environment which adversely affects the sanitation of the salon. In order to control the required space and maintain proper sanitation, where a salon adjoins
    such other business or school, or such other location, space or environment, there must be permanent walls separating the salon from the other business, school, location, space, or environment and there must be separate and distinctly marked
    entrances for each.

    5) Evidence that the full or specialty salon contains a minimum of 100 square feet of floor space. No more than one (1) cosmetologist or specialist may be employed in a salon which has only the minimum floor space. An additional 50 square feet
    will be required for each additional specialist or cosmetologist employed.

    6) Full and specialty salons, regardless of size and number of operators, shall meet all the sanitation requirements stated in this section.

    Chapter 6: Chemical Makeup

    Types Hair/Function Nails
    Hair and nails are actually modified epidermal cells, so these are called skin appendages along with sweat glands and sebaceous glands. Human hair structures develop between 9 weeks and 4 months after conception. All hair structures of the human
    embryo are formed in sequence from the head down to the caudal part of the body. On the head, the first hair structures are formed in corresponding sequence at the eyebrows, the top lip, and the lower chin, then, on the scalp and face and finally
    on the other parts of the head. The hair is classified into two types: terminal hair and vellus hair. Terminal hair may be either long or short. Depending on the location, vellus hair changes to terminal hair when puberty is reached. This chapter
    further describes that nails are a very tough sheet of keratin growing from the epidermis of the dorsal surface of the toes and fingers. They are another form of skin appendages. Nails protect the distal tips of the fingers and toes, enable the
    fingers to grasp very fine objects as well as increase the strength of the fingers and toes.

    Structure and Composition of Hair
    Hair grows out of follicles located in the junction between the deep layers of the dermis and the hypodermis. These follicles are also known as hair bulbs.
    Blood flow is supplied by a small vessel that passes through the inside of the hair shaft, thus providing the hair with all the vital elements it needs to remain healthy such as amino acids, mineral salts or vitamins. The hair shaft is surrounded
    by glands, the most important being the sebaceous gland, which produces sebum that acts as a natural lubricant for the hair. On the surface of the scalp, pores evacuate the sweat produced by the sweat glands.

    Hair Structure
    The hair is made up of 95% keratin, a fibrous, helicoidal protein (shaped like a helix) that forms part of the skin and all its appendages (body hair, nails, etc.).
    Keratin is synthesized by keratinocytes and is insoluble in water, thus ensuring impermeability and protection for the hair. Some 18 amino acids can be found in the hair, such as proline, threonine, leucine and arginine. Keratin is particularly
    rich in cysteine (a type of sulfurated amino acid), which forms disulfide bonds between molecules, adding rigidity and resistance to the entire structure.

    Parts of Hair
    Human hair consists of:
    -the hair shaft, the part that sticks out from the skin's surface
    -the root, a soft thickened bulb at the base of the hair
    -the follicle (FAHL-ih-kul), a sac-like pit in the skin from which the hair grows

    At the bottom of the follicle is the papilla (puh-PILL-uh), where the actual hair growth happens. The papilla contains an artery that nourishes the root of the hair. As cells multiply and make keratin to harden the structure, they're pushed up
    the follicle and through the skin's surface as a shaft of hair. The hair’s structure can be divided into 3 distinct parts:

    -Medulla: innermost layer of the hair shaft, composed of an amorphous, soft, oily substance

    -Cuticle: thin protective outer layer that contains the nourishing portion essential to hair growth. It is highly keratinized, composed of cells shaped like scales that are layered one over the other, measuring about 60 micrometers long and about
    6 micrometers wide.

    -Cortex: main component of the hair, containing long keratin chains that add elasticity, suppleness and resistance to the hair. The cells of the cortex are joined together by an intercellular cement rich in lipids and proteins. Each cell composed
    of bundles that lie in the direction of the hair length: these are macrofibrils which are made up of microfibrils, which in turn contain protofibrils.

    Hair Purpose
    The hair on our heads doesn't just look nice. It keeps us warm by preserving heat. Hair in the nose, ears, and around the eyes protects these sensitive areas from dust and other small particles. Eyebrows and eyelashes protect eyes by decreasing
    the amount of light and particles that go into them. The fine hair that covers the body provides warmth and protects the skin.

    Hair grows by forming new cells at the base of the root. These cells multiply to form a rod of tissue in the skin. The rods of cells move upward through the skin as new cells form beneath them. As they move up, they're cut off from their supply
    of nourishment and start to form a hard protein called keratin. This process is called keratinization (ker-uh-tuh-nuh-ZAY-shun). As this happens, the hair cells die. The dead cells and keratin form the shaft of the hair. Hair grows all over the
    human body except the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips. Hair grows faster in summer than winter, and slower at night than during the day.

    Composition of Skin
    Skin has three layers: the epidermis (ep-ih-DUR-mis), dermis (DUR-mis), and the subcutaneous (sub-kyoo-TAY-nee-us) tissue. The epidermis is the upper layer of skin. This tough, protective outer layer is thin in some areas and thick in others. The
    epidermis has layers of cells that constantly flake off and are renewed. In these layers are three special types of cells:

    -Melanocytes (meh-LAH-nuh-sites) make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin made, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin,
    which is why people get suntanned or freckled.

    -Keratinocytes (ker-uh-TIH-no-sites) make keratin, a type of protein that's a basic component of hair, skin, and nails. Keratin in the skin's outer layer helps create a protective barrier.

    -Langerhans (LAHNG-ur-hanz) cells help protect the body against infection.
    Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly.

    Below the epidermis is the dermis. This is where our blood vessels, nerve endings, sweat glands, and hair follicles are. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis — collagen and elastin — help skin stretch and stay
    firm. The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous (sih-BAY-shiss) glands. These glands make the oil sebum (SEE-bum), which softens the skin and makes it waterproof. The bottom layer of skin is the subcutaneous (sub-kyuh-TAY-nee-iss) tissue.
    It's made of connective tissue , blood vessels, and cells that store fat. This layer helps protect the body from blows and other injuries and helps hold in body heat. Skin, our largest organ, has many jobs. It:

    -protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies
    -forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and germs from entering the body
    -protects body tissues against injury
    -helps control body temperature through sweating when we're hot and by helping -keep heat in the body when we're cold

    Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels.

    Nails Purpose
    Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. We don't need our nails to survive, but they do support the tips of our fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and help us pick up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time
    scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth.

    Nail Parts
    Nails grow out of deep folds in the skin of the fingers and toes. As epidermal cells below the nail root move up to the surface of the skin, they increase in number. Those closest to the nail root get flat and pressed tightly together. Each cell
    becomes a thin plate; these plates pile into layers to form the nail. As with hair, nails form by keratinization. When the nail cells accumulate, the nail pushes forward. The skin below the nail is the matrix. The larger part of the nail, the
    nail plate, looks pink because of the network of tiny blood vessels in the underlying dermis. The whitish crescent-shaped area at the base of the nail is the lunula (LOON-yuh-luh).

    Fingernails grow faster than toenails. Like hair, nails grow faster in summer than in winter. A nail that's torn off will regrow if the matrix isn't severely injured.

    PH Definition
    pH is the Unit of Measure used to express the degree of acidity of a substance. The centimeter is a unit measure of length. The gram is a unit measure of weight. Therefore, pH is the unit measure we use to say how much acid is in a substance. The
    pH scale goes from 0 to 14. A pH of zero means a very high acid activity. Substances such as lemon juice and vinegar are acidic with pH values of 2 to 3. Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid are very strong with pH values of 0, while stomach acid
    has a pH of 1. Addition of a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to water makes the resulting solution very high in active acid concentration. This is called an acidic solution. On the other end of the scale are the alkaline substances,
    which range from 8 to 14. Common alkalis are seawater (pH 8), household ammonia (pH 11), oven cleaners (pH 13), and the very strong alkali, sodium hydroxide (pH 14). The addition of a strong base or alkali material, such as sodium hydroxide (
    NaOH), to water makes the resulting solution very low in active acid concentration. This is called a very basic or alkali solution.
    In between these two extremes is a pH of 7. This is the pH of pure water. Water, which is neither very acidic nor very alkali, is said to be neutral. pH stands for (in our simplified technical purposes) HYDROGEN! As in HOW much hydrogen in the
    chemical in question as in relation to the amount of hydrogen in WATER (good old H2O as in 2 parts hydrogen to one part oxygen.

    Technically, the scale actually refers to the concentration of positively-charged hydrogen (H+) ions and negatively-charged hydroxyl (OH-) ions in solution. More hydrogen ions than hydroxyl ions make an acidic solution, while an alkaline solution
    contains more hydroxyl ions than hydrogen ions. The pH scale is a logarithmic one, meaning that each pH unit has 10 times as many hydrogen ions as the unit above it. Therefore, at pH 4, there are 10 times more hydrogen ions than at pH 5 and 100
    times more hydrogen ions than at pH 6. pH, range of numbers expressing the relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution. In general, pH values range from 0 to 14. The pH of a neutral solution, i.e., one that is neither acidic nor alkaline, is 7.
    Acidic solutions have pH values below 7; alkaline, or basic, solutions have pH values above 7. A pH value provides a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution. In pure water, the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to 0.0000001,
    or 10-7, moles per liter. (A mole is the amount of a substance, expressed in grams, that is equal to the molecular weight, or formula weight, of the substance.) When an acid is added to pure water, the hydrogen ion concentration increases above
    this level. When an alkaline substance, or base, is added to pure water, the hydrogen ion concentration decreases below this level. Once the concentration is determined, the pH value is found by taking the exponent used in expressing this
    concentration and reversing its sign. This is expressed as pH=-log10 [H+]. For example, if the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is 10-4, or 0.0001, moles per liter, the pH is 4. "Hydrogen ions determine pH. The quantity of hydrogen ions
    at or near a sensor surface cause an electrical effect that can be detected and measured by the appropriate instrumentation, thus pH is then derived.” Higher pH levels are called BASE substances (over 7); lower pH levels are called ACID
    substances (under 7).

    PH & Health
    A healthy pH range to target is between 6.0 and 7.5. The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library cites slightly alkaline blood—7.35 to 7.45—as optimal for healthy body functioning. The immune, metabolic, enzymatic, and restorative processes also
    function better in an alkaline state. It is difficult for the average person to determine whether or not they are chronically acidic or not but you can help to ensure that your internal pH level is balanced by choosing a healthy diet and
    lifestyle. For example, foods with high alkalinity including but not limited to: watermelon, cucumbers, strawberries, lemons, apples, asparagus, avocados, broccoli, celery, cabbage, spinach, wheat grass, chia seeds, cold-pressed coconut oil and
    extra virgin olive oil are good to regularly incorporate into your diet to ensure internal pH balance. Trying to avoid chemical-laden foods, sugars, and refined carbs will also help. This dietary advice will not come as a surprise to anyone who
    has consulted a nutritionist or doctor about how to maintain a healthy diet. One disclaimer is that when we say high alkaline food like avocado is good for you we are not saying adopt an all alkaline diet! We would take any advice that an
    “alkaline ash diet” or “alkaline acid diet” will prevent arthritis or cancer with a grain of salt. There are some organs of the body that are more acidic than others for good reasons. For example, your stomach is very acidic, with a pH of 3.5 or
    below, so it can break down food. Overall, choosing more fruits and vegetables over higher-calorie, higher-fat options is great for your heart and important for preventing and treating diabetes, but further studies are warranted in this area of
    medicine. Our philosophy is, like most things in life, moderation is key!

    PH & Haircare
    Human hair and scalp oil, sebum, has a pH balance of between 4.5 and 5.5. This natural hair acidity prevents fungi and bacteria in the hair and scalp, and keeps the cuticle closed and healthy. Hair care products with a pH value in between 3.5 and
    5.5 are considered as being beneficial for hair care products. When pH value drops below 6.0 the hair cuticle contracts and tightens but a substance that is alkaline/basic (pH greater than 7) will cause the hair cuticle to open. Lower pH of
    shampoos may cause less frizzing but studies are needed to establish the best pH range for both the scalp and the hair fiber's health. While a pH value more on the alkaline side (pH greater than 7) is best for specific chemical treatments, if it
    becomes too alkali for too long then you can cause severe irreparable damage to the hair follicle. A more alkaline state can also affect the bacteria and oil on the scalp, and potentially cause dandruff. Curlier textures have naturally opened
    cuticles preventing natural acidic sebum from keeping your hair at a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5. Use shampoos and conditioners that are pH balanced. If you do not know if your products are pH balanced you have two options: buy testing strips to
    evaluate the pH level of your products or ditch those products and buy some that indicate their pH level! Discontinue the use of any product outside of the 4 to 7 pH range. Rinsing your hair with aloe vera juice or diluted apple cider vinegar can
    also restore your hair to a healthy pH level, while imparting great shine and moisture.

    PH & Skincare
    The skin’s acid mantle has an average pH of 4.5 to 6.7, slightly acidic. The acid mantle is a very fine, slightly acidic film on the surface of human skin acting as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might
    penetrate the skin. Sebum is secreted by the sebaceous gland and when mixed with sweat becomes the acid mantle. Skin care products should either match the pH of the acid mantle or be pH-neutral (7) so as not to disrupt your skin's natural
    protection from infectious pathogens. How do you maintain a healthy pH? Well, this can vary form one person to the next. For example, more acidic cleansers may help combat acne, while more alkaline-based skin care ingredients can help maintain
    healthy skin in conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Regardless of which cleanser you choose you should follow-up with a balancing toner. An optional step is to incorporate a plant-based acid toner. Check out our Bible of Acids series to
    learn more about the best types of acids for your skin type. Always follow the toner with a hydrating moisturizer and SPF during the day. The latter is particularly important as UV and environmental particles can negatively affect your skin’s pH
    balance.

    PH & Nails
    The pH of the nail plate surface is around 5. There is no significant difference between the sides, i.e., the right or left hand/foot, among the ten fingernails and between the two great toenails. However, toenails had a significantly higher pH
    than fingernails. Washing the nails causes an immediate, but transient, increase in pH, which is not sustained with time, and pH returns to prewashing levels within 20 min. In males, washing does not significantly influence finger- or toenail
    plate pH. In females, however, washed fingernails have a significantly higher pH than unwashed ones, while there is no difference in the pH of the toenails. The pH of the nail plate interior, measured after tape stripping, is found to be slightly
    lower than that at its surface.

    Toxic Chemicals in Salon Products
    Due to a lack of government oversight, many products used in hair and nail salons contain a number of hazardous chemicals that may harm your health. Below are some particularly toxic chemicals to avoid in salon products, along with the health
    problems these chemicals are linked to.

    What Salon Workers Need to Know
    Many products used in hair and nail salons contain a number of hazardous chemicals that may pose health risks to you and your clients. Unfortunately, salon workers commonly report negative health effects associated with their work. Long term
    studies of salon workers have also reported higher risks of chronic conditions, including certain cancers, immune diseases, asthma, and higher risk of some birth defects in their children. For many chemicals, hazardous ingredients can be avoided
    altogether by purchasing alternative products. For those that can’t be avoided, you can take precautions to protect your health.

    Where to Look for Hazardous Ingredients
    Ingredients in salon products can sometimes be found on the product label, although manufacturers are not required to fully list all ingredients in products sold for professional use. Stylists can look at the Safety Data Sheets associated with
    the product, where some hazardous ingredients (although not all ingredients) must appear. (These sheets should have been sent along with the products). Stylists can call the manufacturer’s customer service line for more information.

    Harmful Chemicals to Avoid
    The chemicals on this list are those which can be reasonably avoided by using currently available products containing safer alternatives.

    Chemical Name/Found in These Products/Symptoms of Exposure/Potential Long Term Effects

    Dibutyl Phthalate/Nail Polish/Nausea, dizziness, eye and skin irritation/Reproductive toxin, birth defects

    Formaldehyde or methylene glycol/Nail hardener, nail polish, keratin hair straightener/Breathing problems, coughing, wheezing, skin rashes, eye nose, throat irritation/Cancer, dermatitis

    Toluene/Nail polish, nail glue, hair dye, wig glue/hairpiece bonding/Dizziness, headaches, skin rashes, eye, nose, throat irritation/Liver damage, kidney damage, birth defects, pregnancy loss

    Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)/Artificial nails/Breathing problems, chest tightness, eye, nose, throat irritation, headaches, confusion/Loss of smell, reproductive toxin, asthma


    Cyclopentasiloxane or cyclomethicone/Flat iron sprays, thermal protection sprays/Under the high heat of a flat iron, cyclopentasiloxane creates formaldehyde. Formaldehyde leads to breathing problems, coughing, wheezing, skin rashes, eye, nose,
    throat irritation/Formaldehyde exposure may cause cancer, dermatitis

    Styrene/Hair extension glue; lace wig glue/Vision problems, trouble concentrating, tiredness/Cancer

    Trichlorethylene/Hair extension glue; lace wig glue/Dizziness, headache, confusion, nausea, eye and skin irritaion/Liver damage, kidney damage, dermatitis, double vision

    1,4 Dioxane/Hair extension glue; lace wig glue/Eye and nose irritation/Cancer, liver damage, kidney damage

    2-Butoxyethanol or Ethylene Glycol Monobutyl Ether/Disinfectants, cleaners/Headache, eye and nose irritation/Reproductive toxin

    Harmful Chemicals to Be Mindful Of
    The following list of chemicals are those known to be harmful to health, but which may be difficult to avoid due to a lack of safer available alternatives. Information about these chemicals is provided here to help you better identify which
    chemicals or products might be most responsible for symptoms you are experiencing.

    Chemical Name/Found in These Products/Symptoms of Exposure/Potential Long Term Effects

    Quaternary Ammonium Compounds or “dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride”/Disinfectants and cleaners/Skin, eye and nose irritation/Asthma

    P-phenylenediamine/Hair dyes, black henna tattoos/Skin irritation/Dermatitis

    Glyceryl thioglycolate/Permanent wave solutions, “acid perms”/Skin irritation/Dermatitis

    Ammonium persulfate/Hair bleach/Eye, skin and nose irritation, coughing, shortness of breath/Asthma, dermatitis

    Ethyl methacrylate /Artificial nails/Eye and skin irritation, rashes on eyelids, face or neck, difficulty concentrating, coughing, shortness of breath/Asthma

    Acetone/Nail polish remover, hairspray/Eye, skin and throat irritation, dizziness/Eye, skin and throat irritation, dizziness

    Acetonitrile/Nail glue remover/Eye, skin and throat irritation, face flush, chest tightness, nausea/Weakness, exhaustion

    Butyl acetate, ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate/Nail polish, nail polish remover, wig glue/hairpiece bonding/Eye, skin and throat irritation, headaches, dizziness/Eye, skin and throat irritation, dermatitis

    Methacrylic acid/Nail primer, eyelash glue/Skin burns, eye, nose and throat irritation/Kidney damage, dermatitis, reproductive toxin

    These lists are not exhaustive. More research is needed to both better identify hazardous chemicals used in salon products, and to develop safer chemical alternatives for harmful chemicals commonly in use.

    Best Practices to Reduce Exposure
    Some harmful chemicals may be difficult to avoid in salon work, due to the current lack of viable alternatives and the lack of ingredient disclosure directly on product labels. For these chemicals, the best advice is to reduce your exposure as
    much as possible by:

    -Ensuring good ventilation in the salon
    -Keeping trash cans tightly closed
    -Using small amounts of the product when performing services
    -Wearing nitrile gloves and protective clothing
    -Washing hands before and after use

    Chapter 7: Environmental Issues & Salons

    Going green and being conscious about environmental issues doesn’t have to mean pedalling for power or cutting hair in the dark. Potentially, all the equipment that you run in a hairdressing salon, beauty clinic or florist shop will be powered by
    non-renewable fossil fuels. Non-renewable energy is energy produced by burning fossil fuels, such as coal. They are non-renewable because there are finite resources, meaning that if they are continually used, one day they will run out. Burning
    fossil fuels contributes to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and to global climate change. Whether you are an employer or apprentice sustainability is becoming more of an issue in cosmetology workplaces.
    Today’s cosmetology salons and clinics often have a range of services that can affect the environment in many ways. Some hairdressing salons or beauty clinics you may work in during your career offer beauty services. These may include nail and
    skin treatments, such as tanning, facials, body wraps, manicures, and make-up applications, as well as many retailing many products. In providing these services, however, many wastes can be generated.

    The most notable environmental issues for salons are:
    -The use of chemical products (dyes, bleaches, solvents)
    -Air pollution (odours)
    -Water use and wastewater disposal
    -Energy use
    -Solid Waste (Paper towels, product containers, other packaging)

    Although individual businesses may not discharge substantial amounts of wastes, the main problem is the combined impact of chemical and waste discharges from many small businesses. A hairdresser’s day-to-day decisions regarding wastes can make a
    large impact on environmental issues. By implementing some basic environmental practices, salons can increase their facilities’ environmental responsibility, and often lower many costs. There are a wide range of chemicals used in the hair and
    beauty industry. Many of these chemicals are hazardous to the environment, but are also of concern to human health.

    Chemicals in Hair Salons
    -hair dyes
    -straighteners
    -bleaches
    -shampoos
    -peroxides
    -brow and lash tints
    -hair styling agents
    -permanent wave solutions
    -disinfectants and cleaning products


    Allergies/Dermititis
    One study in the United States of America has shown that up to 20% of hairdressers leave the business because of allergies or dermatitis.

    Cosmetology Sustainability
    -If a tap drips once every second, 10,000 litres of water are wasted in one year!
    -Don’t leave lights on when there is no one in the salon.
    -Make sure you are using energy-efficient bulbs and not old-fashioned low-efficiency fluorescent tubes. -Energy efficient bulbs might seem more expensive to buy, but they last longer and waste less energy.
    -There is no need to leave any equipment on standby. It’s far more economical to turn appliances off at the power point. If you have a photocopier, computers or televisions that aren’t being constantly used, turn them off each time you have
    finished using them.
    -Don’t forget – screen savers do not save electricity they simply protect the screen. Leaving a photocopier on overnight uses enough energy to print more than 5,000 A4 copies.
    -If you lower the temperature in your hairdressing salon building by 1°C you can cut your heating bills by almost 10%. It’s best to set your thermostats to between 16°C and 19°C.
    -Check your water heater thermostat and make sure it’s at the right temperature. You shouldn’t have to add cold water to hot water to make it the right temperature. Instead, turn your thermostat down.
    -Lighting will account for a large proportion of your electricity bills, so make sure your windows are kept clean to ensure your salon gets as much natural light as possible.
    -If there are areas of the salon that aren’t in constant use, you could fit a sensor light that will only operate when someone enters the area and switch off when there is no further movement.
    -It is also worth regularly servicing your heating system. Costs can increase by about 30% if the system is poorly maintained. Close windows when the heating is on and don’t heat unused rooms.
    -How you launder your towels will have a major impact on the environment. You may be able to switch to cold water with newer washing machines.
    -If you need to update your hot water service then consider buying an efficient system. Up to 90% of the energy used for providing hot water can be wasted because of heat loss and system inefficiencies.

    Real Cost of Cosmetics: Environmental Impact
    When weighing up the cost of makeup, what if the real cost isn’t actually the price tag? Perhaps we should also be paying closer attention to the environmental impact of the beauty brands we choose. Cosmetic packaging can take hundreds of years
    to break down in landfill. Toxic chemicals in cosmetics washed down drains ends up in oceans damaging the eco system and causing death to aquatic species. Livestock affected by toxins that end up in soil can suffer reproductive, genetic, and
    developmental changes as well as many types of cancer.
    Brands adding one or two natural ingredients masking other toxic ingredients are rapidly depleting natural resources. Cosmetics with Palm Oil are contributing to rapid deforestation and climate change.

    Solutions for Sustainable Cosmetics
    At the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit in 2016, Amarjit Sahota, president of Organic Monitor, weighed in on cosmetics and sustainability: “The solutions are not black and white, it’s more like a balancing act and trade offs.” So where does this
    leave you as an ethical consumer wanting to make more sustainable choices? As individuals it’s impossible to live a completely ethical and sustainable lifestyle. It’s about being at peace with doing the best we can to make ethical purchasing
    decisions. Then reuse and recycle to reduce and offset our environmental impact. Naturally, when choosing cosmetics we can look for brands doing their best by implementing initiatives where they can to protect our beautiful planet. Below we
    explore the ways that cosmetics are impacting the environment, and offer sustainable options for you to consider for your own personal ethos.

    Cost of Cosmetics Pretending to be Natural
    Beauty brands jumping on the natural bandwagon by just adding a few natural ingredients to cosmetics that contain a myriad of other toxic ingredients, are not only duping customers but are also damaging the environment with the eradication of
    natural resources and unsustainable farming practices. With the increase of these companies seeking out natural ingredients to fool customers into thinking they are buying natural cosmetics, the demand for natural ingredients has increased. Big
    beauty brands without an eco-conscious want these natural ingredients in large quantities, and they also want it cheap and quickly regardless of the impact to the environment. This results in more pesticides in soil and also depletes
    non-renewable natural resources with unsustainable farming practices.

    Sustainable Options
    -Consider choosing cosmetics made from 100% natural ingredients from beauty brands with a true eco-conscious.
    -Look for cosmetics that have certifications to back their natural beauty claims.
    -Choose beauty brands that have sustainability initiatives in place such as eco-refill programs, minimal packaging and biodegradable wrapping..
    -Look for beauty brands using sustainability sourced cosmetics ingredients.

    Cost of Cosmetics Going Down the Sink
    Did you know toxins in cosmetics damage the environment after they are washed down our sinks? The chemicals in many cosmetics don’t break down and build up in our ecosystems. These toxins can then end up in our oceans, lakes, streams, rivers, and
    water supply. However, it’s not just our sea life that suffers. When water evaporates into the atmosphere, it re-accumulates into clouds, then re-liquefies and returns to the earth as rain- contaminating our soils with toxic chemicals. Next time
    you wash cosmetics with chemical ingredients down the drain, consider the effects the toxins can cause to the environment and eco systems:

    -Reduction in animal plankton population.
    -Change of behaviour and death of aquatic species.
    -BHA and BHT cause death of fish and shellfish.
    -BHA and BHT cause genetic mutations in amphibians.
    -Sodium Laureth Sulfate alters fish behaviour and increases mortality.
    -Dioxane causes death to insects.
    -Diethanolamine (DEA) builds up in the environment and reacts with nitrates to form nitrosamines, which are highly carcinogenic to human and animal life.
    DEA is fatally toxic to amphibians, crustaceans, fish, nematodes, flatworms, and animal plankton.
    -Livestock exposed to chemicals in soil can suffer from reproductive issues and cancer.

    Sustainable Options
    Choose 100% natural cosmetics so that toxic ingredients don’t end up in our eco systems harming sea life and other life on Earth. Look for cosmetic brands that have certifications to back their natural beauty claims so that you are genuinely
    using natural beauty products.

    Cost of Plastics in Cosmetics
    Not only do 70% of cosmetics end up in landfill unfinished, many discarded plastics are ending up in our oceans. Not only can this cause death and harm to sea life, but micro bacteria attach to plastic and create their own eco systems.
    The plastic then travels with this bacteria and can end up on the other side of the world, contaminating other countries with disease.

    Sustainable Options
    Whilst we can’t completely eliminate plastics completely, we can recycle and reuse to reduce the impact to the environment. Reuse your empty cosmetic containers for other purposes, or to ensure they don’t end up our oceans recycle them according
    to your local council’s guidelines. Don’t put your empty cosmetic containers or packaging in a plastic bag. Place them into the recycling bins loose as some sorting machines can’t always sort them and they will end up in landfill.
    There’s no need to waste water washing your containers. Just give them a good scrape clean or use your left over washing-up water. Some councils will accept your cosmetic containers with lids whilst others won’t. It depends on what equipment and
    processes are in place by the Material Recovery Facility. Contact your local council to find out what is right for your area.

    Cost of Palm Oil
    In case you need convincing how important it is to stop using palm oil, it’s chilling to realise that the equivalent of up to 300 football fields an hour are being cleared to make room for palm plantations. Apart from anything else, clearing a
    hectare of forest can release around 6000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
    Clearing for palm oil plantations in the tropics has destroyed vast areas of rainforest. Felling of trees has contributed to climate change and global warming.
    Depletion of forests in Indonesia is particularly concerning because these forests store more carbon per hectare than any other ecosystem in the world.

    Sustainable Options
    Look for beauty brands that have been certified Vegan if you want to completely avoid the use of Palm Oil in your cosmetics. The WWF encourages individuals to raise awareness of the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

    Chapter 8 COVID-19 & Salons

    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by a virus (SARS-COV-2). COVID-19 can sometimes cause serious complications. People at increased risk for severe illness include:
    -Older adults
    -People of any age who have underlying medical conditions

    How COVID-19 Spreads
    COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about it. Here’s what we currently know:
    -It mainly spreads from person-to-person.
    -Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
    -Through respiratory droplets produced when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or talks.
    -You can get the virus from people who don’t seem sick or have symptoms.
    -You might be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.

    As a hair stylist, barber, massage therapist, hair braider, cosmetologist, or esthetician, you might be exposed to the virus at your job when you:
    -Provide services to clients.
    -Are in close contact with clients, coworkers, vendors, service-providers, or delivery people.
    -Touch or handle contaminated surfaces (e.g., with respiratory droplets from someone who coughed) or frequently touched items, cash, or merchandise and then touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.

    How You Can Protect Yourself and Others
    -Stay home if you are having symptoms of COVID-19.
    -Follow CDC recommended steps if you are sick.
    -Do not return to work until you meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation.
    -Talk with your healthcare provider about when it’s safe for you to return to work.
    -Follow CDC recommended precautions.
    -Tell your supervisor or business owner if you are well but someone you live with, or someone you have had recent close contact with, has COVID-19.
    -Stay at least 6 feet away from clients and coworkers, when possible.
    -Be aware of close contact with your fellow employees.
    -Stagger times to use the break room and enter and exit the building.
    -Limit the time that you are close to others, to the extent possible (e.g., shorten appointment times, limit gatherings inside the salon, discourage clients from bringing additional people to appointments).
    -Wear a cloth mask in public and at work, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cloth masks may prevent people who don’t know they have the virus from spreading it to others. Cloth masks are intended to
    protect other people—not the wearer. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth masks are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing.
    -A universal face covering policy can be effective in preventing the transmission of the virus in close-contact interactions, including within a salon.

    Be careful when putting on and taking off cloth masks:
    -Don’t touch the cloth mask while wearing it.
    -Don’t touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes while taking off the cloth mask.
    -Wash your hands before putting on and after taking off the cloth mask.
    -Wash the cloth mask after each use.
    -Consider carrying a spare cloth mask. If the cloth mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.

    Cloth masks should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (for example, interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth masks
    should also not be worn by children under the age of 2, anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the mask without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth masks may
    not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).
    If you are concerned about the use of cloth masks at your workplace, discuss your concerns with your employer. Encourage clients over the age of 2 to wear cloth masks.

    When to Clean
    Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces. Cleaning high touch surfaces
    and shared objects once a day is usually enough to sufficiently remove virus that may be on surfaces unless someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in your facility. Disinfecting (using disinfectants on U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA)’s List Nexternal iconexternal icon) removes any remaining germs on surfaces, which further reduces any risk of spreading infection.

    When to Disinfect
    You may want to either clean more frequently or choose to disinfect (in addition to cleaning) in shared spaces if certain conditions apply that can increase the risk of infection from touching surfaces:

    -High transmission of COVID-19 in your community
    -Low number of people wearing masks
    -Infrequent hand hygiene
    -The space is occupied by people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19
    -If there has been a sick person or someone who tested positive for COVID-19 in your facility within the last 24 hours, you should clean AND disinfect the space.

    Use Disinfectants Safely
    -Always read and follow the directions on how to use and store cleaning and disinfecting products.

    -Ventilate the space when using these products.

    -Always follow standard practices and appropriate regulations specific to your facility for minimum standards for cleaning and disinfection.

    -Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don’t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).

    -Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available.

    -Wash your hands at these key times:
    -Before, during, and after preparing food
    -Before eating food
    -After using the toilet
    -After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
    -After putting on, touching, or removing cloth masks
    -Before and after work and work breaks
    -Before and after each client
    -After cleaning and disinfecting

    -Do not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.

    -Cover your coughs and sneezes.

    -Use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.

    -Throw used tissues in the trash.

    -Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

    How to Cope with Stress
    Mental health is an important part of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and connect with others, which may raise feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. Information and
    resources about mental health, knowing signs of stress, taking steps to manage stress, and knowing where to go if you need help are available here. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/mental-health-non-healthcare.html

    How Your Employer Can Protect You
    Your employer or the salon owner should develop a COVID-19 response plan and share it with you. We created a fact sheet to help your employer.

    How To Get More Information on COVID-19
